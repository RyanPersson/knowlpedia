# Proposed Analysis Reorganization (2026-01-02)

This is a proposed restructuring of the analysis section, breaking it into topic-focused modules.

**Status:** Revised - topology now subdivided into core/metric/compactness/connectedness/separation/baire. Tiny sections (complex, approximation, functional-analysis) deferred for later.

## Deferred (to be organized later)

These knowls exist but will be placed in dedicated sections when those areas are developed:

### Complex analysis (future section)
- complex-conjugate
- complex-numbers-c
- modulus-on-c

### Functional analysis (future section)
- banach-fixed-point-theorem
- completeness-of-ck
- contraction-mapping
- fixed-point
- neumann-series-lemma
