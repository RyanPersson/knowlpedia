Let $\mathfrak g$ be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra.

## Lemma
If $\mathfrak g$ is {{< knowl id="nilpotent-lie-algebra" text="nilpotent" >}} (defined via the {{< knowl id="lower-central-series-lie-algebra" text="lower central series" >}}), then $\mathfrak g$ is {{< knowl id="solvable-lie-algebra" text="solvable" >}} (defined via the {{< knowl id="derived-series-lie-algebra" text="derived series" >}}).

## Context
This inclusion explains why nilpotent Lie algebras sit strictly inside solvable ones; the reverse implication fails in general, and distinguishing solvable from nilpotent is often done by comparing the {{< knowl id="derived-series-lie-algebra" text="derived" >}} and {{< knowl id="lower-central-series-lie-algebra" text="lower central" >}} filtrations.
