**Uniqueness of limits in Hausdorff spaces:** Let $X$ be a {{< knowl id="hausdorff-space" text="Hausdorff space" >}} and let $(x_n)$ be a sequence in $X$. If $(x_n)$ {{< knowl id="convergent-sequence" text="converges" >}} to both $x\in X$ and $y\in X$, then $x=y$.

This property is a key reason Hausdorff spaces behave like metric spaces with respect to convergence, and it is closely aligned with results like {{< knowl id="compact-subset-of-hausdorff-is-closed" text="compact subsets are closed" >}}.
