**Cauchy sequence is bounded:** Let $(X,d)$ be a {{< knowl id="metric-space" text="metric space" >}} and let $(x_n)$ be a {{< knowl id="cauchy-sequence" text="Cauchy sequence" >}} in $X$. Then $\{x_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ is a {{< knowl id="bounded-set" text="bounded set" >}}; equivalently, there exist $x_0\in X$ and $R>0$ such that $d(x_n,x_0)\le R$ for all $n$.

This is often paired with {{< knowl id="complete-metric-space" text="completeness" >}} results: Cauchy behavior already forces the sequence to stay inside some {{< knowl id="closed-ball" text="closed ball" >}}.
