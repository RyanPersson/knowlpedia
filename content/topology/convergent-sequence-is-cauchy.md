**Convergent sequence is Cauchy:** Let $(X,d)$ be a {{< knowl id="metric-space" text="metric space" >}} and let $(x_n)$ be a {{< knowl id="convergent-sequence" text="convergent sequence" >}} with $x_n\to x$ in $X$. Then $(x_n)$ is a {{< knowl id="cauchy-sequence" text="Cauchy sequence" >}}; that is, for every $\varepsilon>0$ there exists $N$ such that if $m,n\ge N$ then $d(x_m,x_n)<\varepsilon$.

Together with the converse implication in {{< knowl id="complete-metric-space" text="complete metric spaces" >}}, this links limits to intrinsic “eventual closeness” of sequence terms.
