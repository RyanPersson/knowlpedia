A **subbasis of a topology** on a set $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{S}$ of subsets of $X$ such that the collection of all finite intersections of members of $\mathcal{S}$ forms a {{< knowl id="basis-of-topology" text="basis" >}} for a topology on $X$. The topology generated by $\mathcal{S}$ consists of all unions of such finite intersections.

Subbases are especially useful for defining topologies via simple building blocks; for instance, the {{< knowl id="product-topology" text="product topology" >}} is most naturally described by a subbasis. They are also convenient for checking {{< knowl id="continuous-map" text="continuity" >}}: it often suffices to control preimages of subbasic sets.

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology, the family of rays $\{(-\infty,a):a\in\mathbb{R}\}\cup\{(a,\infty):a\in\mathbb{R}\}$ is a subbasis.
- For a product $X\times Y$, the sets $\pi_X^{-1}(U)$ and $\pi_Y^{-1}(V)$ (with $U$ open in $X$ and $V$ open in $Y$) form a subbasis, where $\pi_X,\pi_Y$ are the projection maps.
