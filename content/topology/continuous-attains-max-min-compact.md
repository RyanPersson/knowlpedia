**Continuous attains max/min on compact set:** Let $K$ be a {{< knowl id="compact-set" text="compact set" >}} and let $f:K\to\mathbb{R}$ be a {{< knowl id="continuous-map" text="continuous map" >}}. Then there exist points $x_{\min},x_{\max}\in K$ such that
$f(x_{\min})\le f(x)\le f(x_{\max})$ for all $x\in K$.

Equivalently, the subset $f(K)\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ has both a {{< knowl id="minimum" section="real-analysis" text="minimum" >}} and a {{< knowl id="maximum" section="real-analysis" text="maximum" >}}. This can be seen by combining {{< knowl id="continuous-image-of-compact-set-is-compact" text="compactness of continuous images" >}} with basic order properties of compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}$.
