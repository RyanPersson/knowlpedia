**Finite intersection property theorem:** Let $X$ be a {{< knowl id="topological-space" text="topological space" >}} and let $K\subseteq X$ be given the {{< knowl id="subspace-topology" text="subspace topology" >}}. Then $K$ is {{< knowl id="compact-set" text="compact" >}} if and only if for every family $\mathcal{F}$ of {{< knowl id="closed-set" text="closed" >}} subsets of $K$ with the {{< knowl id="finite-intersection-property" text="finite intersection property" >}}, one has $\bigcap_{F\in\mathcal{F}} F\neq\varnothing$.

This is an alternative to the {{< knowl id="open-cover" text="open cover" >}} definition of compactness and is often the most convenient form for “compactness by contradiction.”
