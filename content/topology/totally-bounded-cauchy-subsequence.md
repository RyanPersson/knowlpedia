**Totally bounded implies Cauchy subsequence:** Let $(X,d)$ be a {{< knowl id="metric-space" text="metric space" >}} that is {{< knowl id="totally-bounded-set" text="totally bounded" >}}. Then every sequence $(x_n)$ in $X$ has a {{< knowl id="subsequence" section="real-analysis" text="subsequence" >}} $(x_{n_k})$ that is a {{< knowl id="cauchy-sequence" text="Cauchy sequence" >}}.

This is a key step in the compactness criterion “complete + totally bounded,” and it is closely related to constructing finite {{< knowl id="epsilon-net" text="epsilon-nets" >}} at decreasing scales.
