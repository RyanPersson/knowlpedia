A **sequentially compact set** is a subset $K\subseteq X$ of a {{< knowl id="topological-space" text="topological space" >}} $X$ such that every sequence $(x_n)$ in $K$ has a {{< knowl id="subsequence" section="real-analysis" text="subsequence" >}} $(x_{n_k})$ that is a {{< knowl id="convergent-sequence" text="convergent sequence" >}} in $X$ with limit $x\in K$.

Sequential compactness is phrased purely in terms of sequences, and in many important settings (notably {{< knowl id="metric-space" text="metric spaces" >}}) it closely tracks {{< knowl id="compact-set" text="compactness" >}}.

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology, $[0,1]$ is sequentially compact.
- An infinite set with the discrete topology is not sequentially compact (a sequence of distinct points has no convergent subsequence).
