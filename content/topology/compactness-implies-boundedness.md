**Compactness implies boundedness:** Let $(X,d)$ be a {{< knowl id="metric-space" text="metric space" >}} and let $K\subseteq X$ be a {{< knowl id="compact-set" text="compact set" >}}. Then $K$ is a {{< knowl id="bounded-set" text="bounded set" >}}; equivalently, $\operatorname{diam}(K)<\infty$, where $\operatorname{diam}$ is the {{< knowl id="diameter" text="diameter" >}} induced by $d$.

This is a first step toward “compact sets behave like finite sets” in metric settings, and it complements {{< knowl id="compactness-implies-total-boundedness" text="compactness implies total boundedness" >}}.
