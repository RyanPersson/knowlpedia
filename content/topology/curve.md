A **curve** in a {{< knowl id="topological-space" text="topological space" >}} $X$ is a {{< knowl id="continuous-map" text="continuous map" >}} $\gamma\colon I\to X$, where $I\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ is an {{< knowl id="interval" section="real-analysis" text="interval" >}} (with its usual topology).

A {{< knowl id="path" text="path" >}} is a curve with domain $[0,1]$. Curves allow other parameter intervals, which is convenient for describing parametrizations and restrictions.

**Examples:**
- The map $\gamma(t)=(t,t^2)$ (for $t\in\mathbb{R}$) is a curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$ tracing a parabola.
- If $\gamma\colon [0,2]\to X$ is continuous, then its restriction to $[0,1]$ is a curve (and in fact a path) in $X$.
