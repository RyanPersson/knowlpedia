**Closed subset of compact set is compact:** Let $X$ be a {{< knowl id="topological-space" text="topological space" >}} and let $K\subseteq X$ be {{< knowl id="compact-set" text="compact" >}}. If $F\subseteq K$ is {{< knowl id="closed-set" text="closed" >}} in the {{< knowl id="subspace-topology" text="subspace topology" >}} on $K$ (equivalently, if $F=K\cap C$ for some closed $C\subseteq X$), then $F$ is compact.

This permanence property is frequently combined with the {{< knowl id="finite-intersection-property-theorem" text="finite intersection property characterization" >}} of compactness.
