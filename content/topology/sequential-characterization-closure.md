**Sequential characterization of closure:** Let $(X,d)$ be a {{< knowl id="metric-space" text="metric space" >}}, let $A\subseteq X$, and let $x\in X$. Then
\[
x\in \overline{A}
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
\text{there exists a sequence }(a_n)\text{ in }A\text{ with }a_n\to x,
\]
where $\overline{A}$ denotes the {{< knowl id="closure" text="closure" >}} of $A$.

This turns the topological notion of closure into a sequential condition in metric spaces, and it complements {{< knowl id="sequential-characterization-closed" text="the sequential characterization of closed sets" >}}.
