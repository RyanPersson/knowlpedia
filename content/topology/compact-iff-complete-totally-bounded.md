**Compact iff complete and totally bounded:** Let $(X,d)$ be a {{< knowl id="metric-space" text="metric space" >}}. Then the following are equivalent:

1. $X$ is a {{< knowl id="compact-set" text="compact set" >}}.
2. $X$ is a {{< knowl id="complete-metric-space" text="complete metric space" >}} and {{< knowl id="totally-bounded-set" text="totally bounded" >}}.

Equivalently, a subset $K\subseteq X$ is compact in the {{< knowl id="subspace-topology" text="subspace topology" >}} if and only if $(K,d|_{K\times K})$ is complete and totally bounded.

This characterization packages {{< knowl id="compactness-implies-completeness" text="compactness implies completeness" >}} and {{< knowl id="compactness-implies-total-boundedness" text="compactness implies total boundedness" >}} into a single criterion that is often easier to verify than the {{< knowl id="open-cover" text="open cover" >}} definition.
