**Connected subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are intervals:** View $\mathbb{R}$ with its usual topology (for example, the one induced by the standard metric). If $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is {{< knowl id="connected-set" text="connected" >}}, then $E$ is an {{< knowl id="interval" section="real-analysis" text="interval" >}}: whenever $a,b\in E$ with $a<b$ and $c\in\mathbb{R}$ satisfies $a<c<b$, one has $c\in E$. Conversely, every interval in $\mathbb{R}$ is connected.

This classification is frequently combined with {{< knowl id="continuous-image-of-connected-set-is-connected" text="continuous images preserve connectedness" >}} to identify images of connected sets under real-valued continuous functions.
