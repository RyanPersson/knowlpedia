description: "A subset whose complement is open in the ambient space."

A **closed set** in a {{< knowl id="topological-space" text="topological space" >}} $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a {{< knowl id="subset" section="shared-foundations" text="subset" >}} $F\subseteq X$ such that its complement $X\setminus F$ (the {{< knowl id="set-difference" section="shared-foundations" text="set difference" >}}) is a {{< knowl id="open-set" text="open set" >}}.

Closed sets are the natural targets of the {{< knowl id="closure" text="closure" >}} operation: the closure of $A$ is the smallest closed set containing $A$. Closed sets also provide an equivalent formulation of {{< knowl id="continuous-map" text="continuity" >}} via preimages of closed sets.

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology, $[0,1]$ is closed.
- In the discrete topology on $X$, every subset of $X$ is closed.
- In the indiscrete topology on $X$, the only closed sets are $\varnothing$ and $X$.
