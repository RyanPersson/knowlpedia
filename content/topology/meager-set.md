A **meager set** in a {{< knowl id="topological-space" text="topological space" >}} $X$ is a {{< knowl id="subset" section="shared-foundations" text="subset" >}} $M\subseteq X$ that can be written as a countable {{< knowl id="union" section="shared-foundations" text="union" >}} of {{< knowl id="nowhere-dense-set" text="nowhere dense sets" >}}.

Meager sets are also called “sets of first category.” Their {{< knowl id="complement" section="shared-foundations" text="complements" >}} are the {{< knowl id="residual-set" text="residual sets" >}}; in a {{< knowl id="baire-space" text="Baire space" >}}, meager sets are topologically “small.”

**Examples:**
- Any countable subset of $\mathbb{R}$ (with the usual topology), such as the rationals $\mathbb{Q}$, is meager (a countable union of singleton sets, each nowhere dense).
- Any {{< knowl id="nowhere-dense-set" text="nowhere dense set" >}} is meager (as a countable union of itself).
