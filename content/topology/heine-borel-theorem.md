**Heine–Borel theorem:** In $\mathbb{R}^n$ with its usual metric (and induced topology), a set $K\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is {{< knowl id="compact-set" text="compact" >}} if and only if it is both {{< knowl id="closed-set" text="closed" >}} and {{< knowl id="bounded-set" text="bounded" >}}.

This specializes general implications like {{< knowl id="compactness-implies-boundedness" text="compactness implies boundedness" >}} and {{< knowl id="compactness-implies-closedness" text="compactness implies closedness" >}} into a complete characterization in Euclidean settings, and it is frequently paired with {{< knowl id="bolzano-weierstrass-theorem" text="Bolzano–Weierstrass" >}} and sequential criteria such as {{< knowl id="sequentially-compact-set" text="sequential compactness" >}}.
