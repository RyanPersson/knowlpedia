The **product topology** on a product of {{< knowl id="topological-space" text="topological spaces" >}} $\{(X_i,\mathcal{T}_i)\}_{i\in I}$ is the topology on the set $\prod_{i\in I}X_i$ generated by the subbasis
\[
\{\pi_i^{-1}(U) : i\in I,\ U\in\mathcal{T}_i\},
\]
where $\pi_i:\prod_{j\in I}X_j\to X_i$ is the $i$th projection map.

Equivalently, it is the coarsest topology on $\prod_{i\in I}X_i$ making each projection $\pi_i$ a {{< knowl id="continuous-map" text="continuous map" >}}. In the common case of two spaces $X\times Y$, a {{< knowl id="basis-of-topology" text="basis" >}} is given by sets of the form $U\times V$ with $U$ open in $X$ and $V$ open in $Y$.

**Examples:**
- $\mathbb{R}^n$ with its usual topology can be viewed as the product of $n$ copies of $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology.
- If $X$ is discrete and $Y$ is any space, then basic open sets in $X\times Y$ are unions of sets $\{x\}\times V$ with $V$ open in $Y$.
- In an infinite product $\prod_{i\in I}X_i$, subbasic open sets are “cylinders” that constrain only one coordinate.
