**Sequential compactness equals compactness:** Let $(X,d)$ be a {{< knowl id="metric-space" text="metric space" >}} and let $K\subseteq X$. Then $K$ is {{< knowl id="compact-set" text="compact" >}} if and only if $K$ is {{< knowl id="sequentially-compact-set" text="sequentially compact" >}}, meaning every sequence in $K$ has a {{< knowl id="subsequence" section="real-analysis" text="subsequence" >}} that is {{< knowl id="convergent-sequence" text="convergent" >}} to a point of $K$.

This equivalence fails in general {{< knowl id="topological-space" text="topological spaces" >}} but is fundamental in metric topology and connects compactness to arguments using sequences.
