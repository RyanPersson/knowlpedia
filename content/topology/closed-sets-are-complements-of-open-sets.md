**Closed sets are complements of open sets**: In a {{< knowl id="metric-space" text="metric space" >}} $(X,d)$, a set $F\subseteq X$ is {{< knowl id="closed-set" text="closed" >}} if and only if $X\setminus F$ is {{< knowl id="open-set" text="open" >}}.

Consequently:
- arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed, and
- finite unions of closed sets are closed.

This duality between open and closed sets is a basic tool in topology and analysis, especially for {{< knowl id="closure" text="closure" >}}, {{< knowl id="limit-point" text="limit points" >}}, and compactness arguments.
