**Continuous image of compact set is compact:** Let $f:X\to Y$ be a {{< knowl id="continuous-map" text="continuous map" >}} between {{< knowl id="topological-space" text="topological spaces" >}}. If $K\subseteq X$ is {{< knowl id="compact-set" text="compact" >}}, then $f(K)$ is compact in $Y$, where $f(K)$ is the {{< knowl id="image" section="shared-foundations" text="image" >}} of $K$ under the {{< knowl id="function" section="shared-foundations" text="function" >}} $f$.

This is one of the most important invariance properties in topology; it underlies results like {{< knowl id="continuous-attains-max-min-compact" text="attainment of maxima and minima on compact domains" >}}.
