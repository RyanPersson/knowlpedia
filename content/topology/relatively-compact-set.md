A **relatively compact set** (or **precompact set**) is a subset $A\subseteq X$ of a {{< knowl id="topological-space" text="topological space" >}} $X$ such that its {{< knowl id="closure" text="closure" >}} $\overline{A}$ is {{< knowl id="compact-set" text="compact" >}} in $X$.

Relative compactness depends on the ambient space and topology (it is not purely an intrinsic property of $A$). In metric spaces it is closely related to {{< knowl id="totally-bounded-set" text="total boundedness" >}}.

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology, $(0,1)$ is relatively compact because its closure is $[0,1]$, which is compact.
- In an infinite discrete space, an infinite subset is not relatively compact since its closure is itself and it is not compact.
