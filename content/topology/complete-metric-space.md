A **complete metric space** is a metric space $(X,d)$ in which every {{< knowl id="cauchy-sequence" text="Cauchy sequence" >}} converges (as a {{< knowl id="convergent-sequence" text="convergent sequence" >}}) to a point of $X$.

Completeness is central in analysis and topology; for example it interacts strongly with {{< knowl id="compact-set" text="compactness" >}} (see {{< knowl id="compact-iff-complete-totally-bounded" text="compact iff complete and totally bounded" >}}) and with the {{< knowl id="baire-category-theorem" text="Baire category theorem" >}} (see {{< knowl id="complete-metric-space-is-baire" text="complete metric spaces are Baire" >}}).

**Examples:**
- $(\mathbb{R}^n,\|\cdot\|_2)$ is complete.
- $(\mathbb{Q},|\cdot|)$ is not complete.
