**Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem:** In {{< knowl id="euclidean-space" section="linear-algebra" text="Euclidean space" >}} $\mathbb{R}^n$ with its standard metric, every {{< knowl id="bounded-set" text="bounded" >}} sequence $(x_k)$ has a {{< knowl id="subsequence" section="real-analysis" text="subsequence" >}} that is {{< knowl id="convergent-sequence" text="convergent" >}} in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

This result is a core compactness phenomenon in Euclidean spaces and is closely tied to the {{< knowl id="heine-borel-theorem" text="Heine–Borel theorem" >}} and to {{< knowl id="sequentially-compact-set" text="sequential compactness" >}}.
