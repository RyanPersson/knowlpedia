**Compact-to-Hausdorff homeomorphism criterion:** Let $f:X\to Y$ be a {{< knowl id="continuous-map" text="continuous map" >}} that is bijective. If $X$ is {{< knowl id="compact-set" text="compact" >}} and $Y$ is {{< knowl id="hausdorff-space" text="Hausdorff" >}}, then $f$ is a {{< knowl id="homeomorphism" text="homeomorphism" >}} (equivalently, $f^{-1}:Y\to X$ is continuous).

A common way to use this is via the fact that in a Hausdorff space, {{< knowl id="compact-subset-of-hausdorff-is-closed" text="compact sets are closed" >}}; in particular, under the hypotheses above, images of closed sets in $X$ are closed in $Y$, so $f$ is a closed map.
