**Compact subset of a Hausdorff space is closed:** Let $X$ be a {{< knowl id="hausdorff-space" text="Hausdorff space" >}}. If $K\subseteq X$ is {{< knowl id="compact-set" text="compact" >}}, then $K$ is a {{< knowl id="closed-set" text="closed set" >}} in $X$.

This is one of the basic structural features of Hausdorff spaces and is used repeatedly in compactness arguments, including the {{< knowl id="compact-to-hausdorff-homeomorphism-criterion" text="compact-to-Hausdorff homeomorphism criterion" >}} and uniqueness phenomena such as {{< knowl id="uniqueness-of-limits-hausdorff" text="uniqueness of limits" >}}.
