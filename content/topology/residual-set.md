description: "A set whose complement is meager"

A **residual set** in a {{< knowl id="topological-space" text="topological space" >}} $X$ is a {{< knowl id="subset" section="shared-foundations" text="subset" >}} $R\subseteq X$ whose {{< knowl id="complement" section="shared-foundations" text="complement" >}} $X\setminus R$ is {{< knowl id="meager-set" text="meager" >}}.

Equivalently, $R$ is residual if it contains a countable {{< knowl id="intersection" section="shared-foundations" text="intersection" >}} of sets that are both {{< knowl id="open-set" text="open" >}} and {{< knowl id="dense-set" text="dense" >}}. In a {{< knowl id="baire-space" text="Baire space" >}}, every residual set is dense.

**Examples:**
- The irrationals $\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}$ form a residual subset of $\mathbb{R}$, since $\mathbb{Q}$ is {{< knowl id="meager-set" text="meager" >}}.
- In any Baire space, the intersection of countably many dense open sets is residual (and dense), as captured by {{< knowl id="intersection-of-dense-open-is-dense" text="intersection of dense open sets is dense" >}}.
