**Homeomorphism criterion (compact to metric)**: Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ be {{< knowl id="metric-space" text="metric spaces" >}}. If $X$ is {{< knowl id="compact-set" text="compact" >}} and $f:X\to Y$ is a continuous {{< knowl id="bijective-function" section="shared-foundations" text="bijection" >}}, then $f^{-1}:f(X)\to X$ is continuous. In particular, $f$ is a {{< knowl id="homeomorphism" text="homeomorphism" >}} from $X$ onto $f(X)$.

This result says that on compact domains, a continuous bijection automatically has a continuous inverse (when the target is Hausdorff, which metric spaces are).
