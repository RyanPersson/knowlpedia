title: "Open cover"
description: "A cover consisting entirely of open sets in a topological space."

An **open cover** of a subset $A\subseteq X$ in a {{< knowl id="topological-space" text="topological space" >}} $X$ is a cover $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ of $A$ such that each $U_i$ is an {{< knowl id="open-set" text="open set" >}} in $X$.
Equivalently, $A\subseteq \bigcup_{i\in I}U_i$ and every $U_i$ is open in $X$.

Open covers are the basic input to the definition of {{< knowl id="compact-set" text="compactness" >}}, and refinements of open covers are central in many “finiteness” arguments.

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology, the family $\{(n-1,n+1)\}_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}$ is an open cover of $\mathbb{R}$.
- In $\mathbb{R}$, the family $\{(-1/n,\,1+1/n)\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is an open cover of $[0,1]$.
