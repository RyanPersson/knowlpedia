**Compactness of graphs lemma:** Let $f:X\to Y$ be a {{< knowl id="continuous-map" text="continuous map" >}} between topological spaces, and let
\[
\Gamma_f=\{(x,f(x)):\ x\in X\}\subseteq X\times Y
\]
be its graph, where $X\times Y$ carries the {{< knowl id="product-topology" text="product topology" >}}. If $X$ is {{< knowl id="compact-set" text="compact" >}}, then $\Gamma_f$ is a compact subset of $X\times Y$. If, in addition, $Y$ is {{< knowl id="hausdorff-space" text="Hausdorff" >}}, then $\Gamma_f$ is a {{< knowl id="closed-set" text="closed set" >}} in $X\times Y$.

This observation is often combined with the fact that compact subsets of Hausdorff spaces are closed (see {{< knowl id="compact-subset-of-hausdorff-is-closed" text="compact subsets of Hausdorff spaces are closed" >}}) in arguments about {{< knowl id="homeomorphism" text="homeomorphisms" >}}.
