**Baire category theorem:** Let $(X,d)$ be a {{< knowl id="complete-metric-space" text="complete metric space" >}}. If $(U_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence of {{< knowl id="dense-set" text="dense" >}} {{< knowl id="open-set" text="open sets" >}} in $X$, then the intersection $\bigcap_{n\in\mathbb{N}} U_n$ is dense in $X$.

Equivalently, $X$ is not a countable union of {{< knowl id="nowhere-dense-set" text="nowhere dense sets" >}}; in particular, no nonempty open set is {{< knowl id="meager-set" text="meager" >}}, and every {{< knowl id="residual-set" text="residual set" >}} is dense. This theorem is commonly summarized by saying that complete metric spaces are {{< knowl id="baire-space" text="Baire spaces" >}}.
