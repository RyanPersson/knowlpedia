An **open set** in a {{< knowl id="topological-space" text="topological space" >}} $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a {{< knowl id="subset" section="shared-foundations" text="subset" >}} $U\subseteq X$ such that $U\in\mathcal{T}$.

Open sets are the basic “observable” sets in topology: they define {{< knowl id="neighborhood" text="neighborhoods" >}} of points and determine operations like {{< knowl id="interior" text="interior" >}} and {{< knowl id="closure" text="closure" >}}. They also control {{< knowl id="continuous-map" text="continuity" >}} through preimages.

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology, $(0,1)$ is open.
- In the discrete topology on $X$, every subset of $X$ is open.
- In the indiscrete topology on $X$, the only open sets are $\varnothing$ and $X$.
