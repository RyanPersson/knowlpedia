**Continuous image of a connected set is connected:** Let $f:X\to Y$ be a {{< knowl id="continuous-map" text="continuous map" >}} between topological spaces. If $C\subseteq X$ is {{< knowl id="connected-set" text="connected" >}}, then $f(C)\subseteq Y$ is connected.

This is the main functorial property behind connectedness, and it combines naturally with facts about connected sets in $\mathbb{R}$ (see {{< knowl id="connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals" text="connected subsets of R are intervals" >}}) to identify images of connected domains as intervals.
