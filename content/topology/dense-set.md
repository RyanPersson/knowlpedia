A **dense set** in a {{< knowl id="topological-space" text="topological space" >}} $X$ is a subset $D\subseteq X$ such that its {{< knowl id="closure" text="closure" >}} is all of $X$, i.e. $\overline{D}=X$. Equivalently, $D$ is dense in $X$ if every nonempty {{< knowl id="open-set" text="open set" >}} $U\subseteq X$ intersects $D$.

Density is a way of saying that $D$ is “everywhere in $X$” from the topological viewpoint: every open region contains points of $D$.

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology, $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$.
- In $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology, the irrational numbers are dense in $\mathbb{R}$.
- In a discrete space $X$, the only dense subset is $X$ itself.
