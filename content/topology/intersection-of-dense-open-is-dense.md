description: "In a topological space, the intersection of two dense open sets is again dense (and open)."

**Intersection of dense open sets is dense:** Let $X$ be a {{< knowl id="topological-space" text="topological space" >}} and let $U,V\subseteq X$. If $U$ and $V$ are {{< knowl id="open-set" text="open" >}} and {{< knowl id="dense-set" text="dense" >}} in $X$, then $U\cap V$ is open and dense in $X$.

This uses that a {{< knowl id="topology" text="topology" >}} is closed under finite {{< knowl id="intersection" section="shared-foundations" text="intersections" >}} and is a basic ingredient in many {{< knowl id="baire-category-theorem" text="Baire category" >}} arguments (where one wants to intersect many dense open conditions).
