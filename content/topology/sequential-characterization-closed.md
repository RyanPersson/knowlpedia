**Sequential characterization of closed sets:** Let $(X,d)$ be a {{< knowl id="metric-space" text="metric space" >}} and let $A\subseteq X$. Then $A$ is {{< knowl id="closed-set" text="closed" >}} if and only if for every {{< knowl id="convergent-sequence" text="convergent sequence" >}} $(a_n)$ in $A$ with $a_n\to x$ in $X$, one has $x\in A$.

This is the standard “sequentially closed equals closed” principle for metric spaces, and it pairs naturally with {{< knowl id="sequential-characterization-closure" text="the sequential characterization of closure" >}}.
