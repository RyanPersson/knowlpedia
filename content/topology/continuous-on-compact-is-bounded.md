Let $(X,d)$ be a {{< knowl id="metric-space" text="metric space" >}}, let $K\subseteq X$ be {{< knowl id="compact-set" text="compact" >}}, and let $f:K\to\mathbb{R}$ be {{< knowl id="continuity-on-a-set" section="real-analysis" text="continuous" >}}.

**Proposition**: The function $f$ is {{< knowl id="bounded-set" text="bounded" >}} on $K$: there exists $M<\infty$ such that $|f(x)|\le M$ for all $x\in K$.

This proposition is one of the core reasons compactness is the right hypothesis for global control from local continuity.
