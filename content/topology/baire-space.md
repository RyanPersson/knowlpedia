description: "A topological space in which countable intersections of dense open sets are dense"

A **Baire space** is a {{< knowl id="topological-space" text="topological space" >}} $X$ such that for every sequence $(U_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ of {{< knowl id="open-set" text="open sets" >}} that are {{< knowl id="dense-set" text="dense" >}}, the intersection $\bigcap_{n\in\mathbb{N}} U_n$ is dense in $X$.

This is the setting for {{< knowl id="baire-category-theorem" text="Baire category arguments" >}}: in a Baire space, “large” sets are often expressed as {{< knowl id="residual-set" text="residual sets" >}}, and “small” sets as {{< knowl id="meager-set" text="meager sets" >}} (countable unions of {{< knowl id="nowhere-dense-set" text="nowhere dense sets" >}}).

**Examples:**
- Any {{< knowl id="complete-metric-space" text="complete metric space" >}} is a Baire space (see {{< knowl id="complete-metric-space-is-baire" text="complete metric spaces are Baire" >}}).
- Any {{< knowl id="banach-space" section="linear-algebra" text="Banach space" >}} (with its metric from the norm) is a Baire space.
