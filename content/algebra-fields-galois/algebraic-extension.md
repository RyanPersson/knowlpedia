title: "Algebraic field extension"
description: "An extension L/K in which every element of L is algebraic over K."

**Definition.** A {{</* knowl id="field-extension" text="field extension" */>}} \(L/K\) is **algebraic** if every \(\alpha\in L\) is {{</* knowl id="algebraic-element" text="algebraic over K" */>}}. Equivalently, each \(\alpha\in L\) satisfies some nonzero polynomial in \(K[x]\).

Every finite extension (finite {{</* knowl id="degree-of-extension" text="degree" */>}}) is algebraic, but an algebraic extension can be infinite degree.

**See also.** {{</* knowl id="separable-extension" text="separable extension" */>}}, {{</* knowl id="normal-extension" text="normal extension" */>}}, {{</* knowl id="algebraic-closure" text="algebraic closure" */>}}.

**Examples.**
1. \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt2,\sqrt3)/\mathbb{Q}\) is algebraic (indeed finite).
2. \(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q}\) (the field of all algebraic numbers) is algebraic but has infinite degree.
3. \(\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{R}\) is algebraic of degree \(2\).
