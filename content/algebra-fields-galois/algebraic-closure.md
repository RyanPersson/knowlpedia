**Definition.** An **algebraic closure** of a field \(K\) is a field \(\overline{K}\) together with an inclusion \(K\subseteq \overline{K}\) such that:

1. \(\overline{K}/K\) is an {{</* knowl id="algebraic-extension" text="algebraic extension" */>}}, and  
2. \(\overline{K}\) is **algebraically closed** (every nonconstant polynomial in \(\overline{K}[x]\) has a root in \(\overline{K}\)).

Existence and uniqueness (up to \(K\)-isomorphism) are addressed in {{</* knowl id="algebraic-closure-existence" text="existence" */>}} and {{</* knowl id="algebraic-closure-uniqueness" text="uniqueness" */>}}.

**See also.** {{</* knowl id="splitting-field" text="splitting field" */>}}, {{</* knowl id="normal-extension" text="normal extension" */>}}.

**Examples.**
1. \(\mathbb{C}\) is an algebraic closure of \(\mathbb{R}\) (since \([\mathbb{C}:\mathbb{R}]=2\) and \(\mathbb{C}\) is algebraically closed).
2. The field \(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}\) of all algebraic numbers is an algebraic closure of \(\mathbb{Q}\).
3. An algebraic closure of \(\mathbb{F}_p\) can be realized as \(\bigcup_{n\ge 1}\mathbb{F}_{p^n}\).
