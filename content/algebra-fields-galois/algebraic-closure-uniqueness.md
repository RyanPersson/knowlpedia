**Theorem (Uniqueness up to K-isomorphism).**  
Let \(K\) be a field and let \(\overline{K}_1\) and \(\overline{K}_2\) be algebraic closures of \(K\). Then there exists a \(K\)-isomorphism
\[
\overline{K}_1 \xrightarrow{\ \sim\ } \overline{K}_2
\]
fixing \(K\) pointwise. The isomorphism is not canonical.

This complements {{< knowl id="algebraic-closure-existence" text="existence of algebraic closures" >}}.

**Examples.**
1. Any two choices of \(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}\) (inside possibly different ambient fields) are isomorphic over \(\mathbb{Q}\).
2. Any algebraic closure of \(\mathbb{F}_p\) is isomorphic (over \(\mathbb{F}_p\)) to \(\bigcup_{n\ge1}\mathbb{F}_{p^n}\).
3. If \(\overline{K}\) is fixed, any other algebraic closure can be identified with a \(K\)-subfield of \(\overline{K}\) via such an isomorphism (after choosing one).
