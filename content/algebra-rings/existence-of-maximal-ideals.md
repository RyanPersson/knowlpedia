**Existence of maximal ideals (Zorn)**: Let \(R\) be a {{< knowl id="unital-ring" text="unital ring" >}} with \(1\neq 0\), assumed commutative. Then \(R\) has a {{< knowl id="maximal-ideal" text="maximal ideal" >}}.

This result is typically proved using {{< knowl id="zorns-lemma" section="shared-foundations" text="Zorn's lemma" >}} (and hence the {{< knowl id="axiom-of-choice" section="shared-foundations" text="axiom of choice" >}}) applied to the partially ordered set of proper {{< knowl id="ideal" text="ideals" >}} of \(R\) ordered by inclusion.
