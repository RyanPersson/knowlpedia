**Hilbert basis theorem**: Let \(R\) be a {{< knowl id="commutative-ring" text="commutative ring" >}}. If \(R\) is Noetherian (i.e. every ascending chain of {{< knowl id="ideal" text="ideals" >}} stabilizes), then the {{< knowl id="polynomial-ring" text="polynomial ring" >}} \(R[x]\) is Noetherian. More generally, \(R[x_1,\dots,x_n]\) is Noetherian for every \(n\ge 1\).
