**Wedderburn's little theorem**: Every finite {{< knowl id="division-ring" text="division ring" >}} is commutative. Equivalently, every finite division ring is a {{< knowl id="field" text="field" >}}.

A standard approach studies the finite group \(D^\times\) of units, i.e. the {{< knowl id="group-of-units" text="group of units" >}}, and compares its conjugacy structure with the {{< knowl id="center-of-ring" text="center" >}} of the ring using the {{< knowl id="class-equation" section="algebra-groups" text="class equation" >}}.
