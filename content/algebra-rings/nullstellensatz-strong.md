**Hilbert's Nullstellensatz (strong)**: Let \(k\) be an algebraically closed {{< knowl id="field" text="field" >}} and let \(I\triangleleft k[x_1,\dots,x_n]\) be an {{< knowl id="ideal" text="ideal" >}} in the {{< knowl id="polynomial-ring" text="polynomial ring" >}}. Let
\[
I(V(I))=\{f\in k[x_1,\dots,x_n] : f(a)=0\ \text{for all }a\in V(I)\}.
\]
Then
\[
I(V(I))=\sqrt{I},
\]
where \(\sqrt{I}\) denotes the {{< knowl id="radical-of-ideal" text="radical of an ideal" >}}.

This identifies geometric vanishing with algebraic nilpotence modulo \(I\) and implies, for instance, that varieties correspond to radical ideals and irreducible varieties correspond to {{< knowl id="prime-ideal" text="prime ideals" >}}.
