description: "If R is a UFD, then the polynomial ring R[x] is again a UFD (and likewise in finitely many variables)."

**Gauss's theorem**: If \(R\) is a {{< knowl id="ufd" text="UFD" >}}, then the {{< knowl id="polynomial-ring" text="polynomial ring" >}} \(R[x]\) is a UFD. More generally, \(R[x_1,\dots,x_n]\) is a UFD for all \(n\ge 1\).
