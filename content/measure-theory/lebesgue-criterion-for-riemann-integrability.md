**Lebesgue criterion for Riemann integrability:** Let $f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ be a bounded function on the closed interval $[a,b]$ (see {{< knowl id="interval" section="real-analysis" text="interval" >}}). Let $D_f\subseteq [a,b]$ be the set of points where $f$ is discontinuous. Then $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$ if and only if $D_f$ is a {{< knowl id="null-set" text="null set" >}} with respect to {{< knowl id="lebesgue-measure" text="Lebesgue measure" >}} on $\mathbb{R}$.

Equivalently, a bounded function is Riemann integrable exactly when it is continuous {{< knowl id="almost-everywhere" text="almost everywhere" >}} on $[a,b]$ with respect to Lebesgue measure.
