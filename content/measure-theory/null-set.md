description: "A measurable set of measure zero."

A **null set** in a measure space $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ is a {{< knowl id="measurable-set" text="measurable set" >}} $N\in\Sigma$ such that $\mu(N)=0$.

Null sets are negligible for many purposes: statements that fail only on a null set are said to hold {{< knowl id="almost-everywhere" text="almost everywhere" >}}. Many constructions treat functions that differ only on a null set as essentially the same.

**Examples:**
- The {{< knowl id="empty-set" section="shared-foundations" text="empty set" >}} is always a null set.
- In $\mathbb R$ with {{< knowl id="lebesgue-measure" text="Lebesgue measure" >}}, any singleton $\{x\}$ is a null set.
- In $\mathbb R$ with Lebesgue measure, every countable subset of $\mathbb R$ is a null set.
