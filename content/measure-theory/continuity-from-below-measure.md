**Continuity from below:** Let $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a {{< knowl id="measure-space" text="measure space" >}} and let $E_1,E_2,\dots \in \Sigma$ satisfy
$$
E_1 \subseteq E_2 \subseteq E_3 \subseteq \cdots.
$$
Then
$$
\mu\!\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty E_n\right)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\mu(E_n).
$$

Together with {{< knowl id="continuity-from-above-measure" text="continuity from above" >}}, this expresses how {{< knowl id="measure" text="measures" >}} interact with countable unions and intersections of {{< knowl id="measurable-set" text="measurable sets" >}}.
