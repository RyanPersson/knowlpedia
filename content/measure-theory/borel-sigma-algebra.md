A **Borel sigma-algebra** on a {{< knowl id="topological-space" section="topology" text="topological space" >}} $X$ is the {{< knowl id="sigma-algebra" text="sigma-algebra" >}} $\mathcal B(X)$ generated by the {{< knowl id="open-set" section="topology" text="open sets" >}} of $X$, i.e. the smallest sigma-algebra that contains every open subset of $X$.

Equipping $X$ with $\mathcal B(X)$ turns it into a {{< knowl id="measurable-space" text="measurable space" >}} in a way that is compatible with topology: many naturally occurring functions (especially continuous ones) become {{< knowl id="measurable-function" text="measurable" >}} with respect to Borel sigma-algebras.

**Examples:**
- On $\mathbb R$ with its usual topology, $\mathcal B(\mathbb R)$ is generated by open {{< knowl id="interval" section="real-analysis" text="intervals" >}} such as $(a,b)$.
- If $X$ has the discrete topology (all sets are open), then $\mathcal B(X)=\mathcal P(X)$, the {{< knowl id="power-set" section="shared-foundations" text="power set" >}}.
- If $X$ has the trivial topology $\{\varnothing, X\}$, then $\mathcal B(X)=\{\varnothing, X\}$.
