title: "Product measure"
description: "A measure on a product space determined by its values on measurable rectangles."

A **product measure** combines two measures into a measure on a {{< knowl id="cartesian-product" section="shared-foundations" text="Cartesian product" >}}. Let $(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ and $(Y,\mathcal{B},\nu)$ be {{< knowl id="measure-space" text="measure spaces" >}}. The **product sigma-algebra** $\mathcal{A}\otimes\mathcal{B}$ is the {{< knowl id="sigma-algebra" text="sigma-algebra" >}} on $X\times Y$ generated by measurable rectangles $A\times B$ with $A\in\mathcal{A}$ and $B\in\mathcal{B}$. A measure $\mu\otimes\nu$ on $(X\times Y,\mathcal{A}\otimes\mathcal{B})$ is called a **product measure** if
$$
(\mu\otimes\nu)(A\times B)=\mu(A)\,\nu(B)
\quad\text{for all }A\in\mathcal{A},\ B\in\mathcal{B}.
$$

When $\mu$ and $\nu$ are $\sigma$-finite, such a measure exists and is uniquely determined by its values on rectangles; it is the measure used in {{< knowl id="tonellis-theorem" text="Tonelli's theorem" >}} and {{< knowl id="fubinis-theorem" text="Fubini's theorem" >}} for iterated integration.

**Examples:**
- If $\lambda$ is {{< knowl id="lebesgue-measure" text="Lebesgue measure" >}} on $\mathbb{R}$, then $\lambda\otimes\lambda$ is the standard Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^2$ (and more generally $\lambda^{\otimes n}$ gives Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$).
- If $\mu$ and $\nu$ are counting measures on $\mathbb{N}$, then $\mu\otimes\nu$ is counting measure on $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$: for any finite set $E\subset \mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ one has $(\mu\otimes\nu)(E)=|E|$.
