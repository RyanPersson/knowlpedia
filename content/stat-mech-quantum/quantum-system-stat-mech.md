In (finite-dimensional) quantum statistical mechanics, a **quantum system** can be modeled as a triple
$(\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{A}, H)$ where:

- $\mathcal{H}$ is a {{< knowl id="complex-hilbert-space-finite" section="quantum-foundations" text="finite-dimensional complex Hilbert space" >}}.
- $\mathcal{A}$ is an {{< knowl id="observable-algebra" text="observable algebra" >}}, typically a unital $*$-subalgebra of the algebra of {{< knowl id="bounded-operator-hilbert" section="quantum-foundations" text="bounded operators" >}} on $\mathcal{H}$.
- $H \in \mathcal{A}$ is the {{< knowl id="quantum-hamiltonian" text="Hamiltonian" >}}, assumed {{< knowl id="self-adjoint-operator-observable" section="quantum-foundations" text="self-adjoint" >}} (so that energies are real).

A **state** of the system is represented by a {{< knowl id="density-operator-state" text="density-operator state" >}} $\rho$ on $\mathcal{H}$ (equivalently, a positive normalized linear functional on $\mathcal{A}$). The expectation value of an observable $A \in \mathcal{A}$ in the state $\rho$ is
$$
\langle A\rangle_\rho = \operatorname{Tr}(\rho A),
$$
using the {{< knowl id="trace-operator" section="quantum-foundations" text="trace" >}}. This is the {{< knowl id="quantum-expectation-value" text="quantum expectation value" >}}.

Time evolution for an isolated system is generated by $H$ via a unitary family $U_t$,
$$
U_t = e^{- \frac{i}{\hbar} t H},
\qquad
\rho(t) = U_t\,\rho(0)\,U_t^\dagger,
\qquad
A(t) = U_t^\dagger A(0) U_t.
$$

## Physical interpretation
- $\mathcal{H}$ encodes the system’s kinematic degrees of freedom (what pure states can exist).
- $\mathcal{A}$ encodes which quantities are regarded as measurable observables and how they compose.
- $H$ specifies the energy observable and the dynamics, and it determines equilibrium states such as the {{< knowl id="gibbs-state-quantum" text="quantum Gibbs state" >}}.

## Key properties
- **Noncommutativity:** Typically $\mathcal{A}$ is noncommutative; this expresses incompatibility of observables (order matters for products).
- **States form a convex set:** If $\rho_1,\rho_2$ are states and $0\le \lambda \le 1$, then $\rho=\lambda\rho_1+(1-\lambda)\rho_2$ is also a state. Extreme points correspond to {{< knowl id="quantum-microstate" text="quantum microstates" >}} (pure states).
- **Subsystems and reduction:** If the system is part of a larger one, reduced states are obtained by the {{< knowl id="partial-trace" section="quantum-foundations" text="partial trace" >}}.
- **Equilibrium and thermodynamics:** Given $H$ and an {{< knowl id="inverse-temperature-beta" section="thermodynamics" text="inverse temperature" >}} parameter $\beta$, the canonical equilibrium state and normalization are governed by the {{< knowl id="quantum-partition-function" text="quantum partition function" >}}.
