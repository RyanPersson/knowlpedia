title: "Diathermal wall"
description: "A system boundary that permits heat transfer, allowing subsystems to come to thermal equilibrium."

A **diathermal wall** is an idealized {{< knowl id="system-boundary" text="system boundary" >}} that **allows heat transfer** between a {{< knowl id="thermodynamic-system" text="system" >}} and its {{< knowl id="surroundings-environment" text="surroundings" >}}. In other words, energy may cross the boundary *as heat*, described by the {{< knowl id="heat-inexact-differential" text="inexact differential of heat" >}} $\delta Q$.

**Physical interpretation.**  
A diathermal wall models good thermal contact (e.g., a thin metal interface) so that, when two systems are separated only by such a wall and are otherwise constrained, heat can flow in response to a temperature difference.

**Thermal equilibration.**  
If two subsystems can exchange heat through a diathermal wall and the composite is otherwise isolated from the external environment, they relax toward {{< knowl id="thermal-equilibrium" text="thermal equilibrium" >}}, characterized (in equilibrium thermodynamics) by equality of their temperatures:
$$
T_1 = T_2.
$$
This operational role is tightly connected to the {{< knowl id="zeroth-law-thermodynamics" text="zeroth law" >}}: diathermal contact is the mechanism by which “having the same temperature” becomes an experimentally meaningful notion.

**Contact with a thermal reservoir.**  
When a system is placed in diathermal contact with a {{< knowl id="thermal-reservoir" text="thermal reservoir" >}}, the reservoir idealization implies the system can exchange heat while the reservoir remains at fixed temperature, so the system can relax toward $T = T_R$ (subject to other constraints).

**What a diathermal wall does *not* specify.**  
Diathermal refers only to heat permeability. The wall may still be mechanically rigid (preventing boundary work) or movable (allowing {{< knowl id="work-inexact-differential" text="work" >}} transfer), and it may be impermeable or permeable to matter depending on whether the system is {{< knowl id="closed-system" text="closed" >}} or {{< knowl id="open-system" text="open" >}}.

**Contrast.**  
A perfectly insulating boundary is an {{< knowl id="adiabatic-wall" text="adiabatic wall" >}}, across which heat transfer is excluded.
