title: "Kelvin–Planck–Clausius equivalence"
description: "The Kelvin–Planck and Clausius formulations of the second law are logically equivalent: violating either implies a violation of the other."

## Statement

Two standard formulations of the {{< knowl id="second-law-thermodynamics" section="thermodynamics" text="second law of thermodynamics" >}} are:

- **Kelvin–Planck statement.** No cyclic device can extract heat from a single thermal reservoir and convert it entirely into work (i.e., no 100% efficient single-reservoir heat engine).

- **Clausius statement.** No cyclic device can transfer heat from a colder reservoir to a hotter reservoir without net work input (i.e., no “spontaneous” pumping of heat uphill for free).

**Equivalence theorem.** The Kelvin–Planck statement holds if and only if the Clausius statement holds.

## Key hypotheses and conclusions

**Hypotheses**
- Standard macroscopic bookkeeping consistent with the {{< knowl id="first-law-thermodynamics" section="thermodynamics" text="first law of thermodynamics" >}} (energy conservation over cycles).
- Reservoirs are idealized as bodies at fixed {{< knowl id="temperature-thermo" section="thermodynamics" text="temperature" >}} that can supply/absorb heat without changing temperature.

**Conclusions**
- Either statement may be taken as the second law without loss of generality.
- Carnot-type bounds and entropy inequalities can be derived from either formulation:
  - {{< knowl id="carnot-theorem" section="stat-mech" text="Carnot theorem" >}}
  - {{< knowl id="clausius-theorem-entropy" text="Clausius theorem (entropy)" >}}
  - {{< knowl id="clausius-inequality" section="thermodynamics" text="Clausius inequality" >}}

## Cross-links to definitions

- Second law: {{< knowl id="second-law-thermodynamics" section="thermodynamics" text="second law of thermodynamics" >}}.
- Energy conservation over cycles: {{< knowl id="first-law-thermodynamics" section="thermodynamics" text="first law" >}}.
- Temperature and reservoirs: {{< knowl id="temperature-thermo" section="thermodynamics" text="temperature" >}}.

**Significance.** This equivalence justifies treating “the second law” as a robust principle independent of which operational impossibility statement one starts from, and it underpins both {{< knowl id="carnot-theorem" section="stat-mech" text="Carnot’s theorem" >}} and entropy-based formulations.
