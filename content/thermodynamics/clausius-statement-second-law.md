title: "Clausius statement of the second law"
description: "No cyclic device can transfer heat from a colder body to a hotter body without external work."

The Clausius statement is an operational form of the {{< knowl id="second-law-thermodynamics" text="second law" >}}:

> It is impossible to construct a device operating in a cycle whose sole net effect is to transfer heat from a colder body to a hotter body.

In other words, a refrigerator or heat pump cannot move heat “uphill in {{< knowl id="temperature-thermo" text="temperature" >}}” without consuming work from a {{< knowl id="work-reservoir" text="work source" >}}.

## Physical interpretation

When two bodies are placed in thermal contact through a {{< knowl id="diathermal-wall" text="diathermal wall" >}}, heat flows spontaneously from higher temperature to lower temperature until {{< knowl id="thermal-equilibrium" text="thermal equilibrium" >}} is reached. The Clausius statement asserts that reversing this natural direction requires compensating changes elsewhere—most simply, an input of work.

## Key relations

- **Refrigerator energy balance.** In a cyclic refrigerator exchanging heats with a cold reservoir ($Q_c$ extracted) and a hot reservoir ($Q_h$ delivered), the {{< knowl id="first-law-thermodynamics" text="first law" >}} gives
  $$
  Q_h = Q_c + W_{\text{in}},
  $$

  so moving heat from cold to hot requires positive work input $W_{\text{in}}>0$.

- **Equivalence to other statements.** The Clausius statement is equivalent to the {{< knowl id="kelvin-planck-statement" text="Kelvin–Planck statement" >}}: if either were false, one could combine devices to violate the other. Both are summarized quantitatively by the {{< knowl id="clausius-inequality" text="Clausius inequality" >}}.

- **Entropy viewpoint.** For a closed system exchanging heat with reservoirs, the Clausius statement reflects that total {{< knowl id="thermodynamic-entropy" text="entropy" >}} production is nonnegative, so spontaneous heat flow increases the entropy of the combined “system + reservoirs.”
