title: "Surroundings and environment"
description: "Everything external to the chosen thermodynamic system, which can exchange energy and/or matter with it through the boundary."
---

The **surroundings** (or **environment**) are everything *outside* a {{< knowl id="thermodynamic-system" text="thermodynamic system" >}}. Together, “system + surroundings” form the remainder of the universe relevant to the thermodynamic description, with interactions occurring only through the {{< knowl id="system-boundary" text="system boundary" >}}.

## Physical interpretation
In thermodynamics, the surroundings represent the “rest of the world” that can impose constraints and exchange quantities with the system:
- If the boundary permits, energy may be transferred as {{< knowl id="heat-inexact-differential" text="heat" >}} (driven by temperature differences) or {{< knowl id="work-inexact-differential" text="work" >}} (via generalized forces and boundary displacements).
- If the boundary is permeable, matter exchange can occur, changing {{< knowl id="particle-number" text="particle number" >}} or composition inside the system.

A common idealization is to treat part of the surroundings as a **reservoir**: a very large system whose intensive variables are effectively unchanged by exchanges. For example, a {{< knowl id="thermal-reservoir" text="thermal reservoir" >}} maintains an approximately constant {{< knowl id="temperature-thermo" text="temperature" >}}, and a {{< knowl id="work-reservoir" text="work reservoir" >}} can supply or absorb work without appreciable change in its own macroscopic state.

## Key properties and relations
- The distinction between “system” and “surroundings” is a modeling boundary choice; moving the {{< knowl id="system-boundary" text="boundary" >}} reassigns what is counted as internal energy versus energy transfer.
- For a system treated as {{< knowl id="isolated-system" text="isolated" >}}, the surroundings are thermodynamically irrelevant because no exchange is permitted across the boundary; in practice, “isolated” means interactions with the environment are negligible on the timescale of interest.
- When the surroundings can be idealized as fixed-$T$ or fixed-$p$ reservoirs, they provide the simplest physical route to defining controlled processes such as contact at fixed {{< knowl id="pressure-thermo" text="pressure" >}} or temperature.
