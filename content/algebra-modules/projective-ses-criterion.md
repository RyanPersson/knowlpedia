title: "Projective short exact sequence criterion"
description: "A module is projective iff every short exact sequence ending in it splits."

**Projective s.e.s. criterion**: An \(R\)-module \(P\) is {{</* knowl id="projective-module" text="projective" */>}} if and only if every {{</* knowl id="short-exact-sequence" text="short exact sequence" */>}
\[
0\to A\to B\to P\to 0
\]
is {{</* knowl id="split-exact-sequence" text="split exact" */>}}.

This reformulates projectivity as a splitting property for extensions of \(P\). The “only if” direction uses a lift of \(\mathrm{id}_P\) along the surjection \(B\to P\), and the “if” direction follows by encoding a lifting problem as the splitting of an induced extension (compare the {{</* knowl id="splitting-lemma" text="splitting lemma" */>}})
