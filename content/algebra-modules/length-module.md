title: "Length of a module"
description: "The number of simple factors in a composition series (when finite)."
---

If an $R$-{{< knowl id="module" text="module" >}} $M$ admits a {{< knowl id="composition-series-module" text="composition series" >}}
\[
0=M_0 \subset M_1 \subset \cdots \subset M_n=M,
\]
then the **length** of $M$, denoted $\ell(M)$, is the integer $n$. By the Jordan–Hölder theorem, $\ell(M)$ is well-defined (independent of the chosen composition series) whenever $M$ has at least one composition series; such modules are called “finite length.”

Finite length is tightly linked to chain conditions: modules that are both {{< knowl id="noetherian-module" text="Noetherian" >}} and {{< knowl id="artinian-module" text="Artinian" >}} have finite length; see {{< knowl id="artinian-noetherian-finite-length" text="Artinian + Noetherian ⇒ finite length" >}}.

**Examples:**
- As a $\mathbb Z$-module, $\ell(\mathbb Z/p^k\mathbb Z)=k$.
- If $V$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space over a field, then $\ell(V)=n$.
- (Nonexample) $\mathbb Z$ has infinite length (no finite composition series).
