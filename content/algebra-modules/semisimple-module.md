description: "A module that is a direct sum of simple modules; equivalently, all short exact sequences split."

A module $M$ is **semisimple** if it is (isomorphic to) a {{< knowl id="direct-sum-modules" text="direct sum" >}} of {{< knowl id="simple-module" text="simple modules" >}}. Equivalently, every short exact sequence $0\to A\to M\to B\to 0$ is {{< knowl id="split-exact-sequence" text="split" >}}. Another standard characterization is that every submodule of $M$ is a direct summand; see {{< knowl id="semisimple-direct-summand" text="semisimple implies direct summand" >}}.

Semisimple modules are precisely those with completely reducible submodule structure; they are the module-theoretic analog of diagonalizable operators in linear algebra.

**Examples:**
- Any vector space over a field is semisimple (as a module over that field).
- As a $\mathbb Z$-module, $(\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z)^n$ is semisimple for any prime $p$ and integer $n\ge 1$.
- (Nonexample) $\mathbb Z/p^2\mathbb Z$ is not semisimple as a $\mathbb Z$-module.
