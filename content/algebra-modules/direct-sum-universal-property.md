**Direct sum universal property**: Let $\{M_i\}_{i\in I}$ be a family of $R$-modules, and let $\iota_i:M_i\to \bigoplus_{i\in I}M_i$ be the canonical maps. For any $R$-module $N$ and any family of homomorphisms $f_i:M_i\to N$, there exists a unique homomorphism $f:\bigoplus_{i\in I}M_i\to N$ such that $f\circ \iota_i=f_i$ for all $i\in I$.

This is the defining coproduct property of the {{</* knowl id="direct-sum-modules" text="direct sum" */>}} in the category of $R$-modules, stated in terms of {{</* knowl id="module-homomorphism" text="module homomorphisms" */>}}.
