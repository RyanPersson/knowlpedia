title: "Cyclic module"
description: "A module generated by a single element."

A left $R$-{{< knowl id="module" text="module" >}} $M$ is **cyclic** if there exists $m\in M$ such that
\[
M=Rm=\{rm:r\in R\}.
\]
Equivalently, $M$ is a quotient of $R$ by the {{< knowl id="annihilator-element" text="annihilator of the generator" >}}: the map $R\to M$, $r\mapsto rm$, is surjective with kernel $\operatorname{ann}(m)$, hence induces an isomorphism $R/\operatorname{ann}(m)\cong M$ (as in {{< knowl id="quotient-module" text="quotient modules" >}}).

Cyclic modules are the building blocks for finitely generated modules and connect module structure to ideal structure in the ring.

**Examples:**
- As a $\mathbb Z$-module, $\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z$ is cyclic generated by $1\bmod n$.
- Any {{< knowl id="principal-ideal" section="algebra-rings" text="principal ideal" >}} $(a)\subseteq R$ is a cyclic $R$-module generated by $a$.
- (Edge case) The zero module is cyclic (generated by $0$).
