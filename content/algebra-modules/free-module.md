description: "A module admitting a basis; equivalently, a direct sum of copies of the ring."

A left $R$-{{< knowl id="module" text="module" >}} $F$ is **free** if it has a {{< knowl id="basis-module" text="basis" >}} $B\subseteq F$, i.e. every element of $F$ admits a unique expression as a finite $R$-linear combination of elements of $B$. Equivalently, $F$ is isomorphic to a {{< knowl id="direct-sum-modules" text="direct sum" >}}
of copies of $R$ indexed by $B$.

Free modules are characterized by the {{< knowl id="free-module-universal-property" text="universal property of free modules" >}}: functions from a basis extend uniquely to module homomorphisms. Over a field, free modules coincide with vector spaces and their bases agree with linear-algebra bases.

**Examples:**
- $R^n$ is a free $R$-module with basis $\{e_1,\dots,e_n\}$.
- $\mathbb Z^n$ is a free $\mathbb Z$-module of rank $n$.
- (Nonexample) $\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$ is not free as a $\mathbb Z$-module (it has torsion).
