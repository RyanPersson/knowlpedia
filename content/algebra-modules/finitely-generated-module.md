A left $R$-{{< knowl id="module" text="module" >}} $M$ is **finitely generated** if there exist elements $m_1,\dots,m_n\in M$ such that every $m\in M$ can be written as
\[
m=r_1m_1+\cdots+r_nm_n
\]
for some $r_1,\dots,r_n\in R$. Equivalently, there is a {{< knowl id="surjective-function" text="surjective" >}} homomorphism $R^n\to M$, so $M$ is a quotient of a {{< knowl id="free-module" text="free module" >}} of finite rank.

The case $n=1$ recovers {{< knowl id="cyclic-module" text="cyclic modules" >}}. Finiteness hypotheses are central for structure theorems (e.g. over a PID) and for Noetherian conditions.

**Examples:**
- $\mathbb Z^n$ is finitely generated as a $\mathbb Z$-module, generated by the standard basis vectors.
- $\mathbb Z/12\mathbb Z$ is finitely generated (in fact cyclic) as a $\mathbb Z$-module.
- (Nonexample) $\bigoplus_{n\ge 1}\mathbb Z$ is not finitely generated as a $\mathbb Z$-module.
