description: "A module over an integral domain with no nonzero torsion elements."

Let $R$ be an {{< knowl id="integral-domain" text="integral domain" >}} and $M$ an $R$-{{< knowl id="module" text="module" >}}. The module $M$ is **torsion-free** if its only {{< knowl id="torsion-element" text="torsion element" >}} is $0$, i.e. if $rm=0$ with $0\ne r\in R$ forces $m=0$.

Torsion-freeness is weaker than freeness but is a key hypothesis in many classification results over PIDs and in the theory of lattices.

**Examples:**
- $\mathbb Z^n$ is torsion-free as a $\mathbb Z$-module.
- Any ideal $I$ in an integral domain $R$, viewed as an $R$-module, is torsion-free.
- (Nonexample) $\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z$ is not torsion-free for $n>1$.
