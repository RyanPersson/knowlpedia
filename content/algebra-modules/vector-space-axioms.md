The **vector space axioms** define a {{< knowl id="vector-space" section="linear-algebra" text="vector space" >}} \(V\) over a {{< knowl id="field" section="algebra-rings" text="field" >}} \(k\) as an abelian group \((V,+)\) equipped with scalar multiplication \(k\times V\to V\), \((a,v)\mapsto av\), satisfying the same distributivity/associativity/unit conditions as the {{< knowl id="module-axioms" text="module axioms" >}}:
\[
(a+b)v=av+bv,\quad a(v+w)=av+aw,\quad (ab)v=a(bv),\quad 1v=v.
\]

The field structure on \(k\) (in particular, inverses for nonzero scalars) enables linear algebra constructions such as bases, dimension, and canonical forms.
