description: "A module satisfying the ascending chain condition on submodules."

An $R$-module $M$ is **Noetherian** if it satisfies the ascending chain condition (ACC) on {{</* knowl id="submodule" text="submodules" */>}}: for every chain
\[
N_1 \subseteq N_2 \subseteq N_3 \subseteq \cdots
\]
there exists $k$ such that $N_k=N_{k+1}=\cdots$. Equivalently, every submodule of $M$ is {{</* knowl id="finitely-generated-module" text="finitely generated" */>}}

Noetherian modules are the natural finiteness context for many arguments by maximality and stabilization.

**Examples:**
- $\mathbb Z^n$ is Noetherian as a $\mathbb Z$-module.
- Any finitely generated module over a PID is Noetherian (in particular, any finitely generated abelian group).
- (Nonexample) $\bigoplus_{n\ge 1}\mathbb Z$ is not Noetherian: the submodules generated by the first $k$ basis vectors form a strictly increasing chain.
