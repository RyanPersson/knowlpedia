**Finitely generated projectives are locally free**: Let $R$ be a commutative ring and let $P$ be a finitely generated projective $R$-module. Then for every prime ideal $\mathfrak p\subset R$, the localization $P_{\mathfrak p}$ is a free $R_{\mathfrak p}$-module of finite rank. Equivalently, there exist elements $f_1,\dots,f_n\in R$ generating the unit ideal such that each $P_{f_j}$ is a free $R_{f_j}$-module of finite rank.

This is a fundamental structure theorem for {{< knowl id="projective-module" text="projective modules" >}} over a {{< knowl id="commutative-ring" text="commutative ring" >}}: after localizing at any {{< knowl id="prime-ideal" text="prime ideal" >}}, a {{< knowl id="finitely-generated-module" text="finitely generated" >}} projective becomes {{< knowl id="free-module" text="free" >}} with well-defined {{< knowl id="rank-module" text="rank" >}}.
