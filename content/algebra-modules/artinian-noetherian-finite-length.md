**Artinian and Noetherian implies finite length**: Let $M$ be an $R$-module. If $M$ is both Artinian and Noetherian, then $M$ admits a finite composition series; equivalently, $M$ has finite length.

This combines {{</* knowl id="artinian-module" text="Artinian" */>}} and {{</* knowl id="noetherian-module" text="Noetherian" */>}} chain conditions to produce a finite {{</* knowl id="composition-series-module" text="composition series" */>}}, whose size is measured by {{</* knowl id="length-module" text="module length" */>}}.
