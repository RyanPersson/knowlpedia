**Projective is a summand of free**: An \(R\)-module \(P\) is {{</* knowl id="projective-module" text="projective" */>}} if and only if there exists a {{</* knowl id="free-module" text="free module" */>}} \(F\) and an \(R\)-module \(Q\) such that
\[
F \cong P \oplus Q
\]
as a {{</* knowl id="direct-sum-modules" text="direct sum" */>}}.

This characterization is often the most practical: projective modules are precisely the modules that can be “split off” from free modules (equivalently, retracts of free modules).
