title: "Connected correlations as cumulants"
description: "Connected correlation functions are joint cumulants; they are generated by derivatives of log Z with respect to sources."
---

Connected correlation functions (also called *connected correlators* or *truncated correlations*) isolate the genuinely collective part of fluctuations. Mathematically, they are joint cumulants; physically, they are the pieces of correlation that cannot be explained by lower-order factorization.

This construction is the many-body analogue of the {{< knowl id="construction-cumulant-generating-function" text="cumulant generating function" >}} and sits behind the derivative identities in
{{< knowl id="construction-fluctuation-formulas-log-z" text="fluctuation formulas from log Z" >}}.

## Two-point case: covariance

For observables $A$ and $B$ in an equilibrium ensemble (see {{< knowl id="ensemble-average" text="ensemble average" >}}), the connected two-point function is
$$
\langle AB\rangle_c
\;=\;
\langle AB\rangle \;-\; \langle A\rangle\,\langle B\rangle.
$$

This is exactly the covariance (see {{< knowl id="covariance-observables-ensemble" text="covariance of observables" >}}), and it vanishes when $A$ and $B$ are independent under the ensemble.

When $A$ and $B$ are local observables at points $x,y$, this quantity is the {{< knowl id="connected-correlation-function" text="connected two-point correlation function" >}}, closely related to the ordinary {{< knowl id="correlation-function-two-point" text="two-point correlation function" >}}.

## Higher order: subtracting disconnected pieces

For three observables $A,B,C$, the connected three-point function (third cumulant) is
$$
\langle ABC\rangle_c
={}
\langle ABC\rangle
-\langle AB\rangle\langle C\rangle
-\langle AC\rangle\langle B\rangle
-\langle BC\rangle\langle A\rangle
+2\langle A\rangle\langle B\rangle\langle C\rangle.
$$

This is the part of $\langle ABC\rangle$ that remains after subtracting all lower-order products.

In general, the $n$-point connected correlator is the joint cumulant $\kappa(A_1,\dots,A_n)$, obtained by a combinatorial inclusion–exclusion over partitions of $\{1,\dots,n\}$.

## Generating functional viewpoint: sources and log Z

Introduce sources (fields) coupling to observables. In a classical many-body setting, one writes schematically
$$
Z[J] \;=\; \int \exp\!\left(-\beta H(x) + \int J(r)\,A(r;x)\,\mathrm{d}r\right)\,\mathrm{d}\mu(x),
$$

where $J$ is a space-dependent source and $A(r;x)$ is the microscopic observable density at position $r$.

Then the functional
$$
W[J] \;=\; \log Z[J]
$$
generates connected correlations:
- The first functional derivative of $W$ gives the mean field $\langle A(r)\rangle$.
- The second derivative gives the connected two-point function $\langle A(r)A(r')\rangle_c$.
- Higher derivatives give higher connected correlators.

This is the many-body/statistical-mechanics realization of the probabilistic fact that the log of a moment-generating object generates cumulants.

In finite-dimensional “source vectors” $\lambda$, the same statement is precisely the content of
{{< knowl id="construction-observables-from-log-z" text="deriving observables from log Z" >}}.

## Physical meaning

- **Clustering and independence:** If distant regions become independent (in a suitable limit), connected correlators decay; this is quantified by the {{< knowl id="correlation-length" text="correlation length" >}}.
- **Response theory:** Connected two-point functions control linear response. For a field $h$ conjugate to $A$, one typically has
  $$
  \frac{\partial}{\partial h}\langle A\rangle
  \propto
  \langle A^2\rangle_c,
  $$
  connecting equilibrium fluctuations to susceptibilities (see {{< knowl id="susceptibility-stat-mech" text="susceptibility" >}}).
- **Diagrammatics:** In perturbation expansions, “connected diagrams” contribute to $W=\log Z$, while $Z$ itself sums both connected and disconnected contributions. This is the combinatorial reason $\log Z$ isolates cumulants.

Thus, “connected correlation = cumulant” is not only a definition; it is the organizing principle that turns $\log Z$ into the natural generator of physically meaningful correlations.
