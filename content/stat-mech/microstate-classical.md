A **microstate** of a classical mechanical system is a complete specification of its instantaneous configuration: the positions and momenta of all constituent particles.

Formally, a microstate is a point $(q, p)$ in the system's {{< knowl id="phase-space-classical" text="phase space" >}} $\Gamma$.

## Contrast with macrostate

While a microstate specifies all microscopic details, a {{< knowl id="macrostate" text="macrostate" >}} specifies only macroscopic observables (temperature, pressure, volume, etc.). Many distinct microstates typically correspond to the same macrostate.

## In statistical mechanics

The fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics is that equilibrium properties can be computed by averaging over microstates according to an appropriate probability distribution:

- {{< knowl id="microcanonical-ensemble" text="Microcanonical ensemble" >}}: uniform distribution over microstates at fixed energy.
- {{< knowl id="canonical-ensemble" text="Canonical ensemble" >}}: Boltzmann distribution $\propto e^{-\beta H}$ over all microstates.
- {{< knowl id="grand-canonical-ensemble" text="Grand canonical ensemble" >}}: distribution over microstates with varying particle number.
