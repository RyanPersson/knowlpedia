## Theorem (work identity)

Consider a system with Hamiltonian $H(x;\lambda)$ depending on an external control parameter $\lambda$.
Assume the system starts in equilibrium at inverse temperature $\beta$ with parameter value $\lambda_0$, i.e. with initial distribution given by the {{< knowl id="canonical-ensemble" section="stat-mech" text="canonical ensemble" >}}.

Drive the system with an arbitrary protocol $\lambda_t$ from $t=0$ to $t=\tau$, producing a random work value $W$ along each realization (trajectory). Then the Jarzynski equality states
$$
\left\langle e^{-\beta W}\right\rangle = e^{-\beta \Delta F},
$$

where $\Delta F = F(\lambda_\tau)-F(\lambda_0)$ is the equilibrium Helmholtz free-energy difference (see {{< knowl id="helmholtz-free-energy" section="thermodynamics" text="Helmholtz free energy" >}} and {{< knowl id="free-energy-statistical" section="stat-mech" text="statistical free energy" >}}).

This statement is the theorem-level form of {{< knowl id="jarzynski-equality" text="Jarzynski equality" >}}.

## Work along a protocol (common classical convention)

For Hamiltonian dynamics, the (inclusive) work performed on the system is often written as
$$
W = \int_0^\tau \dot{\lambda}_t\,\partial_\lambda H(x_t;\lambda_t)\,dt,
$$

where $x_t$ is the phase-space trajectory generated by the driven dynamics.

The distribution of $W$ is the {{< knowl id="work-distribution-nonequilibrium" text="work distribution" >}}.

## Immediate corollary (second-law inequality)

By Jensen’s inequality applied to $\langle e^{-\beta W}\rangle$,
$$
\langle W\rangle \ge \Delta F,
$$
consistent with the {{< knowl id="second-law-thermodynamics" section="thermodynamics" text="second law" >}} in isothermal processes (temperature as in {{< knowl id="temperature-thermo" section="thermodynamics" text="temperature" >}}).

## Conditions (typical sufficient assumptions)

Different derivations use different dynamics, but common sufficient conditions include:

- **Equilibrium start:** initial state is Gibbs/canonical at $\lambda_0$.
- **Microreversibility:** underlying dynamics satisfy time-reversal invariance (Hamiltonian case) or, for stochastic dynamics, are consistent with {{< knowl id="detailed-balance" text="detailed balance" >}} with respect to the instantaneous equilibrium family.
- **Well-defined work functional:** depends on a clear convention for what counts as work vs. heat.

## Connections

- The Jarzynski identity is closely related to {{< knowl id="fluctuation-theorem-crooks" text="Crooks fluctuation theorem" >}} and implies it under standard assumptions.
- It provides a practical route to compute {{< knowl id="free-energy-difference-nonequilibrium" text="free-energy differences" >}} from nonequilibrium experiments/simulations via exponential averaging.
