title: "Phase space volume element"
description: "The natural measure for integration over classical phase space, preserved by Hamiltonian time evolution."

For a system with $n$ degrees of freedom and {{< knowl id="phase-space-classical" text="phase space" >}} $\Gamma = \mathbb{R}^{2n}$, the **phase space volume element** is
$$
d\Gamma = d^n q \, d^n p = dq_1 \cdots dq_n \, dp_1 \cdots dp_n.
$$

This is the standard Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, and more generally corresponds to the Liouville measure on a {{< knowl id="symplectic-manifold" section="differential-geometry" text="symplectic manifold" >}}.

## Liouville's theorem

A fundamental property is that Hamiltonian time evolution preserves the phase space volume: if $\Phi_t$ denotes the time-$t$ flow generated by a {{< knowl id="hamiltonian-function-classical" text="Hamiltonian" >}} $H$, then
$$
\Phi_t^* (d\Gamma) = d\Gamma.
$$

This is the classical statement of **Liouville's theorem** and underlies the consistency of equilibrium statistical mechanics.

## In statistical mechanics

The {{< knowl id="microcanonical-ensemble" text="microcanonical ensemble" >}} assigns equal probability to equal phase space volumes on the energy shell. The {{< knowl id="canonical-ensemble" text="canonical" >}} and {{< knowl id="grand-canonical-ensemble" text="grand canonical" >}} measures are absolutely continuous with respect to $d\Gamma$.
