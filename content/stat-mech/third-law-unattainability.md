title: "Unattainability formulation of the third law"
description: "Absolute zero temperature cannot be reached by any finite sequence of thermodynamic operations consistent with the second law."

## Statement
(**Unattainability principle.**) For a {{< knowl id="thermodynamic-system" section="thermodynamics" text="thermodynamic system" >}} governed by the {{< knowl id="second-law-thermodynamics" section="thermodynamics" text="second law of thermodynamics" >}}, it is impossible to reach the state $T=0$ (absolute zero {{< knowl id="temperature-thermo" section="thermodynamics" text="temperature" >}}) from any initial state with $T>0$ by a **finite** sequence of thermodynamic operations.

Common equivalent operational readings include:
- No finite number of (idealized) reversible or irreversible steps can take a system from $T>0$ to $T=0$.
- Any cooling protocol that respects the second law requires resources (time, steps, or auxiliary reservoirs) that diverge as $T\to 0$.

## Key hypotheses
- Thermodynamic description in equilibrium (or quasi-static limits) with well-defined temperature.
- Validity of the second law (e.g., via Kelvin–Planck/Clausius statements; see {{< knowl id="kelvin-planck-clausius-equivalence" section="thermodynamics" text="Kelvin–Planck/Clausius equivalence" >}}).
- “Finite process” interpreted as finitely many steps with finite reservoirs/controls; idealizations are allowed, but not infinite concatenations.

## Conclusions
- $T=0$ is a limit point that cannot be attained by finite operations starting from $T>0$.
- The approach to $T=0$ is constrained even if entropy decreases are allowed via heat extraction; in particular, the ability to use Carnot-like refrigeration cycles is limited as the cold temperature decreases (compare {{< knowl id="carnot-theorem" text="Carnot theorem" >}} and {{< knowl id="carnot-efficiency-formula" text="Carnot efficiency formula" >}}).
