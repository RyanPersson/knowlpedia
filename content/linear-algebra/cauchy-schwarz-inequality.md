**Cauchy–Schwarz inequality:** In an {{< knowl id="inner-product-space" text="inner product space" >}} $(V,\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle)$, for all $x,y\in V$,
\[
|\langle x,y\rangle|\le \|x\|\,\|y\|,
\]
where $\|x\|=\sqrt{\langle x,x\rangle}$ is the induced {{< knowl id="norm" text="norm" >}}. Equality holds if and only if $x$ and $y$ are linearly dependent.

In a {{< knowl id="euclidean-space" text="Euclidean space" >}}, this bounds the dot product by the product of Euclidean lengths. It is central for understanding {{< knowl id="orthogonality" text="orthogonality" >}} and for many norm inequalities in inner product geometry.
