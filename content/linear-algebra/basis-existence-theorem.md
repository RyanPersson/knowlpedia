**Basis existence theorem:** Every {{< knowl id="vector-space" text="vector space" >}} $V$ has a {{< knowl id="subset" section="shared-foundations" text="subset" >}} $B\subseteq V$ such that every $v\in V$ can be written uniquely as a finite linear combination of elements of $B$.

This theorem guarantees that vector spaces admit coordinate descriptions once a basis is chosen, even when $V$ is infinite-dimensional. Standard proofs use Zorn's lemma (equivalently, the axiom of choice), and the result underlies many structural statements about {{< knowl id="linear-map" text="linear maps" >}}.
