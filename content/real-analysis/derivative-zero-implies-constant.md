description: "If the derivative of a differentiable function is zero everywhere on an interval, the function is constant."

**Derivative zero implies constant:** Let $I\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ be an {{< knowl id="interval" text="interval" >}}, and let $f:I\to\mathbb{R}$ be {{< knowl id="differentiability-1d" text="differentiable" >}} on $I$. If
$$
f'(x)=0 \quad \text{for all } x\in I,
$$

then $f$ is constant on $I$.

This is a direct application of the {{< knowl id="mean-value-theorem" text="mean value theorem" >}}: the derivative controls differences $f(y)-f(x)$ on intervals. It can be viewed as a special case of {{< knowl id="derivative-sign-implies-monotonicity" text="derivative sign implies monotonicity" >}} applied in both directions.
