A **rearrangement of a series** $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ is a new series of the form $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_{\sigma(n)}$, where $\sigma$ is a bijection of the positive integers.

For {{< knowl id="absolutely-convergent-series" text="absolutely convergent series" >}}, every rearrangement converges to the same value (see {{< knowl id="rearrangement-theorem-absolute" text="the rearrangement theorem for absolutely convergent series" >}}), while for {{< knowl id="conditionally-convergent-series" text="conditionally convergent series" >}} the behavior can change drastically (see the {{< knowl id="riemann-rearrangement-theorem" text="Riemann rearrangement theorem" >}}).

**Examples:**
- Any rearrangement of $\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n}$ converges to the same sum.
- Rearrangements of $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n}$ can converge to different sums, or even diverge, depending on the permutation.
