**Abel's theorem:** Let $\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n$ be a convergent series of real or complex numbers, with sum $s$. For $0\le x<1$, define
\[
f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n.
\]
Then $f(x)$ is well-defined for every $0\le x<1$, and
\[
\lim_{x\to 1^-} f(x)=s.
\]

This connects ordinary {{< knowl id="convergent-series" text="convergence of series" >}} with boundary behavior of {{< knowl id="power-series" text="power series" >}} and complements radius-of-convergence results such as the {{< knowl id="cauchy-hadamard-theorem" text="Cauchy–Hadamard theorem" >}}.
