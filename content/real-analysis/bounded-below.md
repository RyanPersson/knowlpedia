title: "Bounded below"
description: "A set of real numbers that has a lower bound."

A **bounded below** set is a {{< knowl id="subset" section="shared-foundations" text="subset" >}} $A\subseteq\mathbb R$ for which there exists $m\in\mathbb R$ such that $m\le x$ for every $x\in A$; such an $m$ is called a lower bound of $A$.

This notion uses the {{< knowl id="order-axioms" text="order axioms" >}} and is the basic hypothesis needed to define the {{< knowl id="infimum" text="infimum" >}}. A set can be bounded below without having a {{< knowl id="minimum" text="minimum" >}}.

**Examples:**
- $A=(0,1)$ is bounded below (for example, by $m=0$).
- $A=\mathbb R$ is not bounded below.
