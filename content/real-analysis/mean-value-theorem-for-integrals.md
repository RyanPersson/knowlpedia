**Mean value theorem for integrals:** Let $a<b$ and let $f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ be continuous. Then there exists $c\in[a,b]$ such that
$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = f(c)\,(b-a).
$$

Equivalently, the average value $\frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^b f(x)\,dx$ is achieved by $f$ at some point; this relies on the {{< knowl id="intermediate-value-theorem" text="intermediate value theorem" >}} together with existence of the {{< knowl id="riemann-integral" text="Riemann integral" >}} for continuous functions.
