description: "If a differentiable function has positive derivative everywhere on an interval, then it is strictly increasing."

**Positive derivative implies increasing:** Let $I\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ be an {{< knowl id="interval" text="interval" >}}, and let $f:I\to\mathbb{R}$ be {{< knowl id="differentiability-1d" text="differentiable" >}} on $I$. If
$$
f'(x)>0 \quad \text{for all } x\in I,
$$

then $f$ is strictly increasing on $I$.

This follows from the {{< knowl id="mean-value-theorem" text="mean value theorem" >}} applied to pairs $x<y$ in $I$. The non-strict version is {{< knowl id="derivative-sign-implies-monotonicity" text="derivative sign implies monotonicity" >}}.
