**Second derivative tests:** Let $f:I\to\mathbb{R}$ be twice differentiable on an open interval $I$, and let $c\in I$ satisfy $f'(c)=0$.

- If $f''(c)>0$, then $c$ is a strict local minimum of $f$.
- If $f''(c)<0$, then $c$ is a strict local maximum of $f$.
- If $f''(c)=0$, no conclusion follows from this test alone.

These criteria refine the notion of a {{< knowl id="critical-point" text="critical point" >}} and provide a standard way to detect a {{< knowl id="local-extremum" text="local extremum" >}} using higher {{< knowl id="higher-derivatives" text="derivatives" >}}.
