**Absolute convergence implies convergence:** If a {{< knowl id="series" text="series" >}} $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ is {{< knowl id="absolutely-convergent-series" text="absolutely convergent" >}}, meaning that
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty |a_n|
\]
converges, then the original series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ {{< knowl id="convergent-series" text="converges" >}}.

This principle is a cornerstone of series theory: it justifies treating absolutely convergent series much like finite sums and underlies results such as invariance under {{< knowl id="rearrangement-theorem-absolute" text="rearrangement" >}}.
