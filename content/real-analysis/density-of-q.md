description: "Between any two real numbers there is a rational number."

**Density of $\mathbb{Q}$:** If $a<b$ are real numbers, then there exists a rational number $q\in\mathbb{Q}$ such that $a<q<b$. In fact, there are infinitely many such rationals.

This is a fundamental approximation tool: it shows that every {{< knowl id="interval" text="interval" >}} contains “simple” numbers. Standard proofs combine the {{< knowl id="archimedean-property" text="Archimedean property" >}} with basic order properties from the {{< knowl id="order-axioms" text="order axioms" >}}.
