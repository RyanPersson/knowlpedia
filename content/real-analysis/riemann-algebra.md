**Riemann algebra:** Let $f,g:[a,b]\to\mathbb R$ be {{< knowl id="riemann-integrable-function" text="Riemann integrable" >}} on the {{< knowl id="interval" text="interval" >}} $[a,b]$. Then the product $fg$ is Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$. Consequently, the collection of Riemann integrable functions on $[a,b]$ is closed under pointwise addition, scalar multiplication ({{< knowl id="riemann-linearity" text="linearity" >}}), and pointwise multiplication, hence forms an algebra over $\mathbb R$.

This closure under products is frequently combined with results such as {{< knowl id="composition-preserves-riemann-integrability" text="composition preserving integrability" >}} to build new integrable functions from old ones.
