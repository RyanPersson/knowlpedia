description: "Every nonempty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a least upper bound."

**Completeness axiom (least upper bound property):** If $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and {{< knowl id="bounded-above" text="bounded above" >}}, then $A$ has a {{< knowl id="supremum" text="supremum" >}} in $\mathbb{R}$.

This axiom distinguishes $\mathbb{R}$ from other ordered fields and underlies many foundational results, including the {{< knowl id="monotone-sequence-convergence-theorem" text="monotone sequence convergence theorem" >}} and the equivalences collected in {{< knowl id="completeness-equivalences" text="completeness equivalences" >}}.
