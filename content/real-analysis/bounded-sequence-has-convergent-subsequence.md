**Corollary (Bolzano–Weierstrass, sequence form)**: If $(x_n)$ is a {{< knowl id="bounded-sequence" text="bounded sequence" >}} in $\mathbb{R}^k$, then there exists a {{< knowl id="subsequence" text="subsequence" >}} $(x_{n_j})$ and a point $x\in\mathbb{R}^k$ such that
$
x_{n_j}\to x.
$

**Connection to parent theorem**:
This is exactly the {{< knowl id="bolzano-weierstrass-theorem" section="topology" text="Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem" >}}, often recorded as a corollary once {{< knowl id="compact-set" section="topology" text="compactness" >}}/{{< knowl id="sequentially-compact-set" section="topology" text="sequential compactness" >}} is being developed.
