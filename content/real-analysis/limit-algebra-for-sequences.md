**Limit algebra for sequences:** Let $(a_n)$ and $(b_n)$ be real sequences, and suppose $a_n \to a$ and $b_n \to b$ (in the sense of a {{< knowl id="convergent-sequence" section="topology" text="convergent sequence" >}}). Then:

- $a_n+b_n \to a+b$ and $a_n-b_n \to a-b$.
- For any $c\in\mathbb{R}$, $c\,a_n \to c\,a$.
- $a_n b_n \to ab$.
- If $b\ne 0$ and $b_n\ne 0$ for all sufficiently large $n$, then $\frac{a_n}{b_n}\to \frac{a}{b}$.
- $|a_n|\to |a|$ (see {{< knowl id="absolute-value" text="absolute value" >}}).

These rules are used constantly to build new limits from known ones and often pair with the {{< knowl id="squeeze-theorem" text="squeeze theorem" >}} for estimates.
