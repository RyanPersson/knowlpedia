**Finite discontinuities imply Riemann integrability:** Let $a<b$ and let $f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ be bounded. If the set of points where $f$ has a {{< knowl id="discontinuity-point" text="discontinuity" >}} is finite, then $f$ is a {{< knowl id="riemann-integrable-function" text="Riemann integrable function" >}} on $[a,b]$.

This gives a practical sufficient condition for Riemann integrability that can be checked by analyzing the {{< knowl id="set-of-discontinuities" text="set of discontinuities" >}}; it is often proved using the {{< knowl id="oscillation-criterion" text="oscillation criterion" >}}.
