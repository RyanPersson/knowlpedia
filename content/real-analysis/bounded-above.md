title: "Bounded above"
description: "A set of real numbers that has an upper bound."

A **bounded above** set is a {{< knowl id="subset" section="shared-foundations" text="subset" >}} $A\subseteq\mathbb R$ for which there exists $M\in\mathbb R$ such that $x\le M$ for every $x\in A$; such an $M$ is called an upper bound of $A$.

This notion depends on the {{< knowl id="order-axioms" text="order axioms" >}} and is the basic hypothesis needed to define the {{< knowl id="supremum" text="supremum" >}}. A set can be bounded above without having a {{< knowl id="maximum" text="maximum" >}}.

**Examples:**
- $A=(0,1)$ is bounded above (for example, by $M=1$).
- $A=\mathbb R$ is not bounded above.
