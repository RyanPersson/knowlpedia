title: "Terms go to zero"
description: "A necessary condition for a series to converge is that its terms tend to zero."

**Terms go to zero:** If the {{< knowl id="series" text="series" >}} $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ {{< knowl id="convergent-series" text="converges" >}}, then
\[
\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = 0.
\]

Equivalently (the divergence test), if $a_n$ does not tend to $0$, then the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ is {{< knowl id="divergent-series" text="divergent" >}}. This is a basic prerequisite for many convergence tests and is often used to quickly rule out convergence before applying finer criteria like the {{< knowl id="root-test" text="root test" >}} or {{< knowl id="ratio-test" text="ratio test" >}}.
