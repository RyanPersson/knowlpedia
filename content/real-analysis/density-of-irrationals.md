**Density of the irrationals:** If $a<b$ are real numbers, then there exists an irrational number $x\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}$ such that $a<x<b$. In fact, there are infinitely many such irrationals.

Together with the {{< knowl id="density-of-q" text="density of the rationals" >}}, this implies that every nontrivial {{< knowl id="interval" text="interval" >}} contains both rational and irrational points, a key intuition behind approximation and continuity arguments.
