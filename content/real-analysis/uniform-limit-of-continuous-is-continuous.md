**Uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous:** Let $X$ be a {{< knowl id="metric-space" section="topology" text="metric space" >}} and let $Y$ be a metric space. If each $f_n:X\to Y$ is {{< knowl id="continuous-map" section="topology" text="continuous" >}} and $f_n\to f$ {{< knowl id="uniform-convergence" text="uniformly" >}} on $X$, then $f:X\to Y$ is continuous.

This is one of the key ways {{< knowl id="uniform-convergence" text="uniform convergence" >}} improves on {{< knowl id="pointwise-convergence" text="pointwise convergence" >}}: continuity is preserved under uniform limits but not under pointwise limits in general.
