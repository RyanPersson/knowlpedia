**Least Upper Bound Theorem**: If $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and {{< knowl id="bounded-above" text="bounded above" >}}, then $\sup E$ exists in $\mathbb{R}$.

This theorem is the working form of {{< knowl id="completeness-axiom" text="completeness" >}}: it guarantees the existence of optimal bounds and is used to prove convergence of {{< knowl id="monotone-sequence" text="monotone sequences" >}}, the existence of limits, and many properties of continuous functions.
