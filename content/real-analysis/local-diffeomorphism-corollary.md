**Local diffeomorphism corollary:** Let $U\subseteq\mathbb R^k$ be an {{< knowl id="open-set" section="topology" text="open set" >}} and let $f:U\to\mathbb R^k$ be continuously differentiable. If $\det Df(x)\ne 0$ for every $x\in U$, then for each $x_0\in U$ there exist neighborhoods $A$ of $x_0$ and $B$ of $f(x_0)$ such that the restriction $f:A\to B$ is a {{< knowl id="diffeomorphism" text="diffeomorphism" section="fiber-bundles">}}.

This is an immediate consequence of the {{< knowl id="inverse-function-theorem-rk" text="inverse function theorem" >}} applied at each point, and it is the standard meaning of saying that $f$ is a “local diffeomorphism.”
