title: "Maximum"
description: "The largest element of a set of real numbers, when it exists."

A **maximum** of a {{< knowl id="subset" section="shared-foundations" text="subset" >}} $A\subseteq\mathbb R$ is an element $m\in A$ such that $x\le m$ for every $x\in A$.

If a maximum exists, it is unique and equals the {{< knowl id="supremum" text="supremum" >}} of $A$. Many sets have a supremum but no maximum (for instance, open intervals).

**Examples:**
- For $A=[0,1]$, the maximum is $1$.
- For $A=\{2,5,3\}$, the maximum is $5$.
