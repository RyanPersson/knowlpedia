title: "Minimum"
description: "The smallest element of a set of real numbers, when it exists."

A **minimum** of a {{< knowl id="subset" section="shared-foundations" text="subset" >}} $A\subseteq\mathbb R$ is an element $m\in A$ such that $m\le x$ for every $x\in A$.

If a minimum exists, it is unique and equals the {{< knowl id="infimum" text="infimum" >}} of $A$. Many sets have an infimum but no minimum (for instance, open intervals).

**Examples:**
- For $A=[0,1]$, the minimum is $0$.
- For $A=\{2,5,3\}$, the minimum is $2$.
