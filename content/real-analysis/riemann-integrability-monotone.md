description: "Every monotone function on a closed interval is Riemann integrable."

**Monotone functions are Riemann integrable:** Let $a<b$. If $f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ is {{< knowl id="monotone-function" text="monotone" >}}, then $f$ is a {{< knowl id="riemann-integrable-function" text="Riemann integrable function" >}} on $[a,b]$.

This theorem is a cornerstone of the Riemann theory, providing integrability for many non-continuous examples; it complements criteria based on {{< knowl id="discontinuity-point" text="discontinuities" >}} and the {{< knowl id="oscillation-criterion" text="oscillation criterion" >}}.
