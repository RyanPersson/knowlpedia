**Uniform convergence implies pointwise convergence:** Let $E$ be a set and let $f_n:E\to\mathbb{R}$ (or $\mathbb{C}$) be functions. If $f_n\to f$ {{< knowl id="uniform-convergence" text="uniformly" >}} on $E$, then $f_n\to f$ {{< knowl id="pointwise-convergence" text="pointwise" >}} on $E$; that is, for every $x\in E$ we have $f_n(x)\to f(x)$.

The converse generally fails: {{< knowl id="pointwise-convergence" text="pointwise convergence" >}} alone is typically too weak to preserve analytic properties such as continuity.
