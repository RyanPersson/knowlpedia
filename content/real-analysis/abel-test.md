**Abel test:** Consider a series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n b_n$ of real or complex numbers. Suppose

1. the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ {{< knowl id="convergent-series" text="converges" >}}, and
2. the sequence $(b_n)$ is monotone and bounded.

Then the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n b_n$ converges.

Abel’s test can be viewed as complementary to the {{< knowl id="dirichlet-test" text="Dirichlet test" >}}: Dirichlet assumes bounded {{< knowl id="partial-sums" text="partial sums" >}} of $(a_n)$ and $b_n\to 0$, while Abel assumes convergence of $\sum a_n$ and only boundedness of $(b_n)$.
