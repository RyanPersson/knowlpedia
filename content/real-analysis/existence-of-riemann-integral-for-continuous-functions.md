**Continuous functions are Riemann integrable**: If $f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ is {{< knowl id="continuity-on-a-set" text="continuous" >}}, then $f$ is {{< knowl id="riemann-integrable-function" text="Riemann integrable" >}} on $[a,b]$.

This theorem guarantees that the {{< knowl id="riemann-integral" text="Riemann integral" >}} covers all standard functions from calculus and is a basic entry point for more refined integrability criteria.
