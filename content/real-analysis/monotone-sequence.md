description: "A real sequence that is nondecreasing or nonincreasing."

A **monotone sequence** is a sequence $(a_n)_{n\ge 1}$ of real numbers such that either
- $a_n\le a_{n+1}$ for all $n$ (monotone increasing), or
- $a_n\ge a_{n+1}$ for all $n$ (monotone decreasing).

A sequence can be viewed as a {{< knowl id="function" section="shared-foundations" text="function" >}} from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb R$. Monotone sequences are central in the {{< knowl id="monotone-sequence-convergence-theorem" text="monotone sequence convergence theorem" >}}, which combines monotonicity with being {{< knowl id="bounded-above" text="bounded above" >}} or {{< knowl id="bounded-below" text="bounded below" >}}.

**Examples:**
- $a_n=1-\tfrac1n$ is monotone increasing.
- $a_n=\tfrac1n$ is monotone decreasing.
