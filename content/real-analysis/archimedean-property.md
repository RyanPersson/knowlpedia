**Archimedean property:** For every real number $x$ there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n > x$. Equivalently, for every $\varepsilon>0$ there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $0<\frac{1}{n}<\varepsilon$.

This property is a basic consequence of the interaction between the {{< knowl id="order-axioms" text="order axioms" >}} and the {{< knowl id="completeness-axiom" text="completeness axiom" >}}. It is used repeatedly in approximation arguments, for example in the {{< knowl id="density-of-q" text="density of the rationals" >}}.
