A **differentiable function (one variable)** is a {{< knowl id="function" section="shared-foundations" text="function" >}} $f:I\to\mathbb{R}$ that has a {{< knowl id="derivative" text="derivative" >}} at a point $a\in I$ (meaning $f'(a)$ exists), and it is differentiable on $I$ if it is differentiable at every point of $I$.

Differentiability is stronger than continuity, as recorded in {{< knowl id="differentiability-implies-continuity" text="differentiability implies continuity" >}}. It interacts with order and shape through results such as {{< knowl id="derivative-sign-implies-monotonicity" text="derivative sign implies monotonicity" >}}.

**Examples:**
- Every {{< knowl id="polynomial" text="polynomial" >}} is differentiable at every real number.
- The function $f(x)=|x|$ is not differentiable at $x=0$.
