**Riemann rearrangement theorem:** Let $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ be a real series that is {{< knowl id="convergent-series" text="convergent" >}} but not {{< knowl id="absolutely-convergent-series" text="absolutely convergent" >}} (equivalently, it is {{< knowl id="conditionally-convergent-series" text="conditionally convergent" >}}). Then:

- For every $L\in\mathbb{R}$, there exists a bijection $\pi:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ such that the rearranged series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_{\pi(n)}$ converges to $L$.
- There also exist rearrangements that diverge to $+\infty$, diverge to $-\infty$, or fail to have a limit.

This theorem highlights the sharp difference between conditional convergence and the stability enjoyed by {{< knowl id="rearrangement-theorem-absolute" text="absolutely convergent series under rearrangement" >}}.
