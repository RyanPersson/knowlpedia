**Arzelà–Ascoli theorem:** Let $K$ be a compact {{< knowl id="metric-space" section="topology" text="metric space" >}}, and let $f_n:K\to\mathbb{R}$ be {{< knowl id="continuous-map" section="topology" text="continuous" >}} for all $n$. If the sequence $(f_n)$ is {{< knowl id="uniformly-bounded-family" text="uniformly bounded" >}} and {{< knowl id="equicontinuity" text="equicontinuous" >}}, then there exists a {{< knowl id="subsequence" text="subsequence" >}} $(f_{n_k})$ and a continuous function $f:K\to\mathbb{R}$ such that $f_{n_k}\to f$ {{< knowl id="uniform-convergence" text="uniformly" >}} on $K$.

In the language of the {{< knowl id="space-of-continuous-functions" text="space of continuous functions" >}} with the {{< knowl id="supremum-norm" text="supremum norm" >}}, this is a compactness criterion for extracting uniformly convergent subsequences from equicontinuous, uniformly bounded families.
