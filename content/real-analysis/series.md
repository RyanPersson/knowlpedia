A **series** is a formal expression $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ together with the associated {{< knowl id="partial-sums" text="partial sums" >}} $s_n=\sum_{k=1}^n a_k$.

Whether a series has a value is determined by the behavior of its partial sums: it either {{< knowl id="convergent-series" text="converges" >}} or {{< knowl id="divergent-series" text="diverges" >}}. Many standard tools for deciding this are collected as convergence tests such as the {{< knowl id="ratio-test" text="ratio test" >}} and the {{< knowl id="comparison-test" text="comparison test" >}}.

**Examples:**
- The geometric series $\sum_{n=0}^\infty r^n$.
- The harmonic series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n}$.
