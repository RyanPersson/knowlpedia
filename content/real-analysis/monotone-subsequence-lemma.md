**Monotone subsequence lemma:** Every real sequence $(a_n)$ has a {{< knowl id="subsequence" text="subsequence" >}} that is {{< knowl id="monotone-sequence" text="monotone" >}} (either nondecreasing or nonincreasing).

This combinatorial compactness principle is often paired with boundedness assumptions to extract convergent subsequences and to analyze $\limsup$ and $\liminf$ (see {{< knowl id="limit-superior" text="limsup" >}} and {{< knowl id="limit-inferior" text="liminf" >}}).
