A **polynomial** (in one real variable) is a function $p:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ of the form
\[
p(x)=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\cdots+a_n x^n
\]
for some integer $n\ge 0$ and coefficients $a_0,\dots,a_n\in\mathbb{R}$. If $a_n\ne 0$, the integer $n$ is the degree of $p$.

Polynomials are basic examples of smooth functions (they have {{< knowl id="higher-derivatives" text="derivatives of all orders" >}}) and they define continuous functions on any interval, so they sit inside the {{< knowl id="space-of-continuous-functions" text="space of continuous functions" >}} on that interval. Collections of polynomials often form a {{< knowl id="subalgebra-of-continuous-functions" text="subalgebra of continuous functions" >}}.

**Examples:**
- $p(x)=x^3-2x+5$ is a polynomial of degree $3$.
- $p(x)=7$ is a constant polynomial (degree $0$), and $p(x)=0$ is the zero polynomial.
