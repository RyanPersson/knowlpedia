**Rolle's theorem:** Let $f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $[a,b]$ and {{< knowl id="differentiability-1d" text="differentiable" >}} on $(a,b)$. If $f(a)=f(b)$, then there exists $c\in(a,b)$ such that
$$
f'(c)=0.
$$

This is a foundational consequence of the existence of a {{< knowl id="local-extremum" text="local extremum" >}} for continuous functions on compact intervals, and it is the key ingredient in the {{< knowl id="mean-value-theorem" text="mean value theorem" >}}.
