**Uniform limit theorem for continuity**: Let $(X,d)$ be a {{< knowl id="metric-space" section="topology" text="metric space" >}} and let $(f_n)$ be a sequence of {{< knowl id="continuity-on-a-set" text="continuous" >}} functions $f_n:X\to\mathbb{R}$ (or into any metric space). If $f_n\to f$ {{< knowl id="uniform-convergence-of-a-sequence-of-functions" text="uniformly" >}} on $X$, then $f$ is continuous on $X$.

{{< knowl id="uniform-convergence-of-a-sequence-of-functions" text="Uniform convergence" >}} is strong enough to pass continuity through the limit. This is a fundamental reason uniform convergence is preferred over {{< knowl id="pointwise-convergence" text="pointwise convergence" >}} in analysis.
