title: "Isolated point"
description: "A point of a set that has a neighborhood containing no other points of the set."

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space and let $A\subseteq X$. A point $x\in A$ is an **isolated point** of $A$ if there exists $r>0$ such that
$$B(x,r)\cap A=\{x\}.$$

Isolated points are the opposite of limit points: near an isolated point there are no other points of the set. Sets can have both isolated points and limit points.

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb{R}$, every integer $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ is an isolated point of $\mathbb{Z}$ (take $r=1/2$).
- In $\mathbb{R}$, $1$ is an isolated point of $\{1\}\cup\{1/n:n\in\mathbb{N}\}$.
- In $\mathbb{R}$, no point of $(0,1)$ is isolated in $(0,1)$.
