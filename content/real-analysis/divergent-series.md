title: "Divergent series"
description: "A series whose partial sums do not converge to a finite limit."
---

A **divergent series** is a {{< knowl id="series" text="series" >}} whose {{< knowl id="partial-sums" text="partial sums" >}} do not converge to a finite limit, i.e. it is not a {{< knowl id="convergent-series" text="convergent series" >}}.

Divergence may happen because partial sums grow without bound or because they oscillate. A basic necessary condition for convergence is {{< knowl id="terms-go-to-zero" text="terms go to zero" >}}, whose contrapositive often certifies divergence quickly.

**Examples:**
- The harmonic series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n}$ diverges.
- The series $\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n$ diverges, since its partial sums alternate between $1$ and $0$.
