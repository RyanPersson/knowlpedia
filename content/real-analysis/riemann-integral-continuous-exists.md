**Continuous implies Riemann integrable:** Let $a<b$. If $f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ is continuous (as a {{< knowl id="continuous-map" section="topology" text="continuous map" >}}), then $f$ is a {{< knowl id="riemann-integrable-function" text="Riemann integrable function" >}} on $[a,b]$.

In practice, this guarantees the existence of the {{< knowl id="riemann-integral" text="Riemann integral" >}} for most elementary functions, and it interacts well with the {{< knowl id="mean-value-theorem-for-integrals" text="mean value theorem for integrals" >}} and the {{< knowl id="fundamental-theorem-of-calculus-i" text="fundamental theorem of calculus" >}}.
