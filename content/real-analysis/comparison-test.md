**Comparison test:** Let $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ and $\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n$ be {{< knowl id="series" text="series" >}} with $a_n\ge 0$ and $b_n\ge 0$ for all $n$.

- If $0 \le a_n \le b_n$ for all sufficiently large $n$ and $\sum b_n$ is a {{< knowl id="convergent-series" text="convergent series" >}}, then $\sum a_n$ is convergent.
- If $0 \le a_n \le b_n$ for all sufficiently large $n$ and $\sum a_n$ is a {{< knowl id="divergent-series" text="divergent series" >}}, then $\sum b_n$ diverges.

This test reduces many convergence questions to comparisons with standard benchmark series, and it is complemented by the {{< knowl id="limit-comparison-test" text="limit comparison test" >}} when direct inequalities are hard to establish.
