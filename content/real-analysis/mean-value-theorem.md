**Mean value theorem:** Let $f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $[a,b]$ and {{< knowl id="differentiability-1d" text="differentiable" >}} on $(a,b)$. Then there exists $c\in(a,b)$ such that
$$
f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.
$$

The {{< knowl id="mean-value-theorem" text="mean value theorem" >}} is obtained from {{< knowl id="rolles-theorem" text="Rolle's theorem" >}} by applying Rolle to a suitable affine adjustment of $f$. It yields useful corollaries such as the {{< knowl id="mean-value-estimate-lemma" text="mean value estimate" >}} and monotonicity criteria from the sign of the {{< knowl id="derivative" text="derivative" >}}.
