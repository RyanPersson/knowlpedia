**Uniform convergence preserves boundedness:** Let $E$ be a set and let $f_n:E\to\mathbb{R}$ be functions. If each $f_n$ is bounded on $E$ and $f_n\to f$ {{< knowl id="uniform-convergence" text="uniformly" >}} on $E$, then $f$ is bounded on $E$. Moreover, the family $\{f_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ is {{< knowl id="uniformly-bounded-family" text="uniformly bounded" >}}: there exists $M<\infty$ such that $|f_n(x)|\le M$ for all $n$ and all $x\in E$.

This is frequently used together with the {{< knowl id="uniform-convergence-supnorm" text="supremum-norm characterization of uniform convergence" >}}.
