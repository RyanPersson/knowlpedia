**Uniform convergence in supremum norm:** Let $E$ be a set and let $f_n,f:E\to\mathbb{R}$ be bounded functions. Then $f_n\to f$ {{< knowl id="uniform-convergence" text="uniformly" >}} on $E$ if and only if
\[
\|f_n-f\|_\infty \longrightarrow 0,
\]
where $\|g\|_\infty=\sup_{x\in E}|g(x)|$ is the {{< knowl id="supremum-norm" text="supremum norm" >}}.

In particular, uniform convergence is exactly convergence in the metric induced by the supremum norm, which underlies the {{< knowl id="space-of-continuous-functions" text="space of continuous functions" >}} equipped with $\|\cdot\|_\infty$.
