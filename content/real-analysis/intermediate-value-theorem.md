**Intermediate value theorem:** Let $f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $[a,b]$. If $y$ is any number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ (that is, $\min\{f(a),f(b)\}\le y\le \max\{f(a),f(b)\}$), then there exists $c\in[a,b]$ such that
$$
f(c)=y.
$$

This is one of the basic consequences of being a {{< knowl id="continuous-map" section="topology" text="continuous map" >}} on an {{< knowl id="interval" text="interval" >}}. A notable application is {{< knowl id="darboux-theorem" text="Darboux's theorem" >}}, which shows that derivatives also satisfy an intermediate value property.
