**Uniqueness of supremum/infimum:** Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be nonempty.

- If $s$ and $t$ are both {{< knowl id="supremum" text="suprema" >}} of $A$, then $s=t$.
- If $u$ and $v$ are both {{< knowl id="infimum" text="infima" >}} of $A$, then $u=v$.

This guarantees that the notation $\sup A$ and $\inf A$ is unambiguous whenever these numbers exist, which is ensured under the hypotheses of the {{< knowl id="completeness-axiom" text="completeness axiom" >}} (for $\sup$) and its dual (for $\inf$).
