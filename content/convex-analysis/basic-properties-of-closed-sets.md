**Proposition.**
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. Then:

1. $\emptyset$ is closed.
2. $X$ is closed.
3. The intersection of any collection of {{< knowl id="closed-subset" text="closed sets" >}} is closed.
4. The union of finitely many closed sets is closed.

**Proof sketch.** Use complements and the corresponding results for open sets: complements turn arbitrary intersections into arbitrary unions and finite unions into finite intersections.
