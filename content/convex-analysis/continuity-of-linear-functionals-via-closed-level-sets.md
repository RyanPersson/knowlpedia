title: "Continuity of Linear Functionals via Closed Level Sets"
description: "A linear functional on a normed space is continuous iff one of its level sets is closed."
---

Let $X$ be a real {{< knowl id="norm-normed-vector-space" text="normed space" >}}, let $f:X\to\mathbb{R}$ be a nonzero linear functional, and let $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$.

**Theorem**: The functional $f$ is continuous if and only if the level set
$$
A:=\{x\in X\mid f(x)=\alpha\}
$$
is a {{< knowl id="closed-subset" text="closed subset" >}} of $X$.

**Context:**
This links geometric closedness of a {{< knowl id="hyperplane" text="hyperplane" >}} level set to analytic boundedness of $f$ (compare {{< knowl id="bounded-linear-functional-norm-of-a-functional" text="bounded linear functionals" >}}). It is used to upgrade algebraic separation in vector spaces to separation by **closed** hyperplanes in normed spaces; see {{< knowl id="separation-by-closed-hyperplane-under-interior-condition" text="closed hyperplane separation" >}}.
