title: "Closed set"
description: "A set whose complement is open"
---

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space and let $F\subset X$.

The set $F$ is **closed** if its complement $F^c:=X\setminus F$ is {{< knowl id="open-subset" text="open" >}}.

Closed sets are stable under arbitrary intersections and finite unions (see {{< knowl id="basic-properties-of-closed-sets" text="basic properties of closed sets" >}}). The {{< knowl id="closure-of-a-set" text="closure" >}} of a set is the smallest closed set containing it.

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb{R}$, every closed interval $[a,b]$ is closed.
- In any metric space, $\emptyset$ and $X$ are closed.
- In a discrete metric space, every subset of $X$ is closed.
