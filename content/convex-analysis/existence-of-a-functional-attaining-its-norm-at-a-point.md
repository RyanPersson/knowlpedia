title: "Existence of a Norming Functional"
description: "For any nonzero z0, there is a bounded functional f with ||f||=1 and f(z0)=||z0||."

Let $X$ be a {{< knowl id="norm-normed-vector-space" text="normed space" >}} and let $z_0\in X\setminus\{0\}$.

**Corollary**: There exists a {{< knowl id="bounded-linear-functional-norm-of-a-functional" text="bounded linear functional" >}} $f:X\to\mathbb{K}$ such that
$$
\|f\|=1\quad\text{and}\quad f(z_0)=\|z_0\|.
$$

This is a direct consequence of {{< knowl id="separation-of-a-point-and-a-subspace" text="separation of a point and a subspace" >}} by applying it to $Y=\{0\}$ and $x_0=z_0/\|z_0\|$.
