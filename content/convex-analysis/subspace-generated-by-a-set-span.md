title: "Span"
description: "The smallest linear subspace containing a given set"
---

Let $X$ be a vector space and let $A\subset X$.

The **linear subspace generated by $A$**, also called the **span** of $A$, is defined as
$$
\operatorname{span}(A):=\bigcap\{\,Y\subset X \mid Y \text{ is a linear subspace of }X\text{ and }A\subset Y\,\}.
$$

Equivalently, it is the intersection of all {{< knowl id="linear-subspace" text="subspaces" >}} containing $A$, hence the **smallest** subspace that contains $A$.

A central theorem (see {{< knowl id="span-equals-the-set-of-all-finite-linear-combinations" text="span as linear combinations" >}}) identifies $\operatorname{span}(A)$ with all finite {{< knowl id="linear-combination" text="linear combinations" >}} of elements of $A$.

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb{R}^2$, $\operatorname{span}\{(1,0)\}$ is the $x$-axis.
- In $\mathbb{R}^3$, $\operatorname{span}\{(1,0,0),(0,1,0)\}$ is the $xy$-plane.
- If $A=\emptyset$, then $\operatorname{span}(A)=\{0\}$ (intersection of all subspaces).
