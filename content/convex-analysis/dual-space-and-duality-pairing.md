description: "The continuous dual X* and the pairing ⟨x*,x⟩=x*(x)."

Let $X$ be a {{< knowl id="norm-normed-vector-space" text="normed space" >}} over $\mathbb{R}$.

The **(continuous) dual space** $X^*$ is the set of all continuous linear functionals $x^*:X\to\mathbb{R}$ (equivalently, all {{< knowl id="bounded-linear-functional-norm-of-a-functional" text="bounded linear functionals" >}} on $X$).

For $x^*\in X^*$ and $x\in X$, the **duality pairing** is
$$
\langle x^*,x\rangle:=x^*(x).
$$

This pairing is the standard language used in separation theorems such as {{< knowl id="separation-by-a-closed-hyperplane" text="separation by a closed hyperplane" >}} and {{< knowl id="strict-separation-by-a-closed-hyperplane" text="strict separation" >}}.
