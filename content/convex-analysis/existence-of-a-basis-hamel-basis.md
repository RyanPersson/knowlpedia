**Corollary (Existence of a Hamel basis).**
If $X$ is a vector space with $X\neq\{0\}$, then $X$ has a {{< knowl id="basis-hamel-basis-and-dimension" text="basis" >}}, i.e., a Hamel basis.

**Connection to the extension theorem.** Pick any nonzero $x\in X$. Then $\{x\}$ is linearly independent, so {{< knowl id="extension-of-a-linearly-independent-set-to-a-basis" text="the extension theorem" >}} produces a basis containing $\{x\}$.

**Remark.** If $X=\{0\}$ is the trivial vector space, it is standard to declare the empty set to be a basis of $X$ (so that "every vector space has a basis" holds uniformly).

**Examples:**
- $\mathbb{R}^n$ has the standard basis.
- Infinite-dimensional examples (like all sequences) have a Hamel basis, but it typically cannot be written down explicitly.
