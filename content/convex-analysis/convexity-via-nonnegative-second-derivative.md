description: "A twice differentiable function is convex iff f''≥0 on the interval"

**Corollary.**
Let $f:I\to\mathbb{R}$ be twice differentiable on a nonempty open interval $I\subset\mathbb{R}$. Then $f$ is convex on $I$ if and only if
$$
f''(x)\ge 0 \quad \text{for all }x\in I.
$$

**Connection.** This follows from {{< knowl id="convexity-characterized-by-monotonicity-of-derivative" text="convexity ⇔ monotone derivative" >}}, since $f''\ge 0$ is equivalent to $f'$ being nondecreasing.
