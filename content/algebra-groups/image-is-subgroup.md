**Proposition (Image is a subgroup).**
Let $f:G\to H$ be a {{< knowl id="group-homomorphism" text="group homomorphism" >}}. Let $\mathrm{im}(f)$ be its {{< knowl id="image-group" text="image" >}}. Then $\mathrm{im}(f)$ is a {{< knowl id="subgroup" text="subgroup" >}} of $H$.

**Context.**
Together with "kernel is normal," this gives the basic structural picture of any homomorphism: it factors through a quotient of $G$ onto a subgroup of $H$.
