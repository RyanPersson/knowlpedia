**Sylow's First Theorem.**
Let $G$ be a finite {{< knowl id="group" text="group" >}}, and write $|G| = p^{a}m$ where $p$ is prime and $p \nmid m$. Then $G$ has a {{< knowl id="subgroup" text="subgroup" >}} of order $p^{a}$. Any subgroup of order $p^{a}$ is called a {{< knowl id="sylow-subgroup" text="Sylow p-subgroup" >}}.

Sylow's first theorem vastly strengthens {{< knowl id="cauchys-theorem-groups" text="Cauchy's theorem" >}} (the case $a=1$). Together with {{< knowl id="sylows-second-theorem" text="Sylow's second theorem" >}} and {{< knowl id="sylows-third-theorem" text="Sylow's third theorem" >}}, it controls the existence and placement of maximal {{< knowl id="p-group" text="p-groups" >}} inside $G$.
