title: "Normal Closure"
description: "The smallest normal subgroup containing a given subset"
---

Let $G$ be a {{< knowl id="group" text="group" >}} and let $A\subseteq G$. The **normal closure** of $A$ in $G$, denoted $\langle\!\langle A\rangle\!\rangle$, is the smallest {{< knowl id="normal-subgroup" text="normal subgroup" >}} of $G$ containing $A$. Equivalently,
$$
\langle\!\langle A\rangle\!\rangle \;=\; \bigcap\{N\trianglelefteq G : A\subseteq N\},
$$

the intersection of all normal subgroups containing $A$.

A concrete description is: $\langle\!\langle A\rangle\!\rangle$ is the {{< knowl id="generated-subgroup" text="subgroup generated" >}} by all conjugates $gag^{-1}$ with $g\in G$ and $a\in A$ (so it is the smallest normal subgroup closed under conjugation containing $A$), which ties it to the {{< knowl id="conjugation-action" text="conjugation action" >}}

**Examples:**
- In $S_3$, the normal closure of a transposition is all of $S_3$ (because conjugates of a transposition are all transpositions, and these generate $S_3$).
- In $S_3$, the normal closure of a $3$-cycle is $A_3$.
- If $G$ is abelian, then every subgroup is normal, so the normal closure of $A$ is just the subgroup generated by $A$.
