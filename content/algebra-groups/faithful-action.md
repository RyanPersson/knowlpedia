title: "Faithful Action"
description: "An action with trivial kernel, equivalently an injective permutation representation"
---

A {{< knowl id="group-action" text="group action" >}} of a group $G$ on a set $X$ is **faithful** if its {{< knowl id="kernel-of-action" text="kernel" >}} is the {{< knowl id="trivial-subgroup" text="trivial subgroup" >}}. Equivalently, the associated homomorphism $G\to \mathrm{Sym}(X)$ is a {{< knowl id="group-monomorphism" text="monomorphism" >}}, i.e. injective.

Faithful actions are exactly those that realize $G$ as a subgroup of a permutation group; this viewpoint underlies {{< knowl id="cayleys-theorem" text="Cayley's theorem" >}}.

**Examples:**
- The left translation action of $G$ on itself is faithful (and in fact regular).
- The conjugation action of $G$ on itself is faithful iff $Z(G)=\{e\}$.
- If $G$ is abelian and nontrivial, the conjugation action is not faithful (every element acts trivially).
