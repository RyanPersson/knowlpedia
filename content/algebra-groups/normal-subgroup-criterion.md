**Normal Subgroup Criterion**: Let $G$ be a {{< knowl id="group" text="group" >}} and let $N\le G$ be a {{< knowl id="subgroup" text="subgroup" >}}. Then $N$ is a {{< knowl id="normal-subgroup" text="normal" >}} subgroup of $G$ if and only if for every $g\in G$ and every $n\in N$ one has $gng^{-1}\in N$.

Equivalently, $N$ is normal if and only if $gNg^{-1}=N$ for all $g\in G$ (where $gNg^{-1}=\{gng^{-1}:n\in N\}$). This says precisely that $N$ is invariant under the {{< knowl id="conjugation-action" text="conjugation action" >}} of $G$ on itself.
