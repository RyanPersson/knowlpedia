**Proposition (Product of normal subgroups).**
Let $G$ be a {{< knowl id="group" text="group" >}} and let $N,M \lhd G$ be {{< knowl id="normal-subgroup" text="normal subgroups" >}}. Define
$$
NM \;=\; \{nm : n\in N,\ m\in M\}\subseteq G.
$$

Then $NM$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. Moreover, $NM=MN$.

**Context.**
Products like $NM$ appear in building larger normal subgroups from smaller ones (e.g. in series and extensions). The equality $NM=MN$ is a typical "normality makes products commute setwise" phenomenon.
