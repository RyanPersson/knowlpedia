**Cauchy's Theorem (Finite Groups).**
Let $G$ be a finite {{< knowl id="group" text="group" >}}, and let $p$ be a prime number such that $p \mid |G|$. Then there exists an element $g \in G$ with $g \ne e$ and $g^p = e$; equivalently, $G$ has a {{< knowl id="cyclic-subgroup" text="cyclic subgroup" >}} of order $p$.

Cauchy's theorem is a partial converse to {{< knowl id="lagranges-theorem" text="Lagrange's theorem" >}}: instead of saying "subgroup orders divide $|G|$," it guarantees the existence of elements of certain prime orders when that prime divides $|G|$. It is a key input for {{< knowl id="sylows-first-theorem" text="Sylow's first theorem" >}}.
