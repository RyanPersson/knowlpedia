title: "Generating Set"
description: "A subset whose elements generate the whole group"

Let $G$ be a {{< knowl id="group" text="group" >}} and let $S\subseteq G$. One says that **$S$ generates $G$** (or that $S$ is a generating set) if the smallest {{< knowl id="subgroup" text="subgroup" >}} of $G$ containing $S$ is all of $G$, i.e.
$$
\langle S\rangle = G,
$$
where $\langle S\rangle$ denotes the {{< knowl id="generated-subgroup" text="subgroup generated" >}} by $S$. Equivalently, every element of $G$ can be written as a finite product of elements of $S$ and their inverses.

Generating sets are the input data for {{< knowl id="group-presentation" text="presentations" >}}, and finiteness of generating sets is a basic measure of complexity.

**Examples:**
- $\mathbb{Z}$ is generated by $\{1\}$ under addition.
- $C_n=\langle a\rangle$ is generated by any element of order $n$.
- $S_3$ is generated by $\{(12),(123)\}$ (many other generating sets exist).
