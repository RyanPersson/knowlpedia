Let $S$ be a {{< knowl id="set" text="set" >}}. A **free group on $S$** is a group $F(S)$ together with an injection $i:S\to F(S)$ such that the following universal property holds:

For every group $G$ and every {{< knowl id="function" text="function" >}} $f:S\to G$, there exists a unique {{< knowl id="group-homomorphism" text="group homomorphism" >}} $\widetilde f:F(S)\to G$ with $\widetilde f\circ i = f$.

Concretely, elements of $F(S)$ can be represented by reduced words in symbols from $S$ and their formal inverses. Free groups are the starting point for {{< knowl id="group-presentation" text="group presentations" >}}: adding relations corresponds to taking a quotient.

**Examples:**
- The free group on one generator is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$ (send the generator to $1$).
- The free group on two generators has elements represented by reduced words in $a^{\pm1},b^{\pm1}$ (e.g. $ab^{-1}a^{-1}b$).
- If $S=\varnothing$, then $F(S)$ is the trivial group.
