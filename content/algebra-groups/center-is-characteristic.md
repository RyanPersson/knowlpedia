**Proposition (Center is characteristic).**
Let $G$ be a {{< knowl id="group" text="group" >}} and let $Z(G)$ denote its {{< knowl id="center-of-group" text="center" >}}. Then $Z(G)$ is a {{< knowl id="characteristic-subgroup" text="characteristic subgroup" >}} of $G$; that is, for every automorphism $\varphi\in \mathrm{Aut}(G)$ one has $\varphi(Z(G))=Z(G)$.

**Context.**
"Characteristic" is stronger than normal: every characteristic subgroup is normal, but not conversely. The center is the basic example of a subgroup defined purely by the intrinsic multiplication structure of $G$, so it must be preserved by all automorphisms.
