**Schreier Refinement Theorem.**
Let $G$ be a {{< knowl id="group" text="group" >}}. Consider two finite {{< knowl id="subnormal-series" text="subnormal series" >}} (normal series)
$$
G = G_0 \triangleright G_1 \triangleright \cdots \triangleright G_n,
\qquad
G = H_0 \triangleright H_1 \triangleright \cdots \triangleright H_m,
$$

where each inclusion is normal in the previous term. Then there exist refinements of these series (obtained by inserting additional intermediate subgroups) such that the refined series have the same length and their successive factor groups are pairwise {{< knowl id="group-isomorphism" text="isomorphic" >}} up to a permutation. Each factor group is a {{< knowl id="quotient-group" text="quotient group" >}} of the form $A/B$ with $B \trianglelefteq A$.

Schreier refinement is the main structural comparison tool for normal series. It is the standard input for {{< knowl id="jordan-holder-theorem-groups" text="the Jordan–Hölder theorem" >}}.
