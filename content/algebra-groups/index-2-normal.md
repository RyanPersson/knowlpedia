**Subgroup of Index 2 is Normal**: Let $G$ be a {{< knowl id="group" text="group" >}} and let $H\le G$ be a {{< knowl id="subgroup" text="subgroup" >}}. If the {{< knowl id="index-of-subgroup" text="index" >}} of $H$ in $G$ is $2$, then $H$ is {{< knowl id="normal-subgroup" text="normal" >}} in $G$.

Equivalently: if there are exactly two left {{< knowl id="coset" text="cosets" >}} of $H$ in $G$, then the left cosets equal the right cosets, so $gH=Hg$ for all $g\in G$.
