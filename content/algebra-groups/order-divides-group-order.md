**Order of Element Divides Order of Group**: Let $G$ be a finite {{< knowl id="group" text="group" >}} (so $|G|$ denotes its cardinality), and let $g\in G$. The **order of $g$**, written $\operatorname{ord}(g)$, is the least integer $n\ge 1$ such that $g^n=e$, where $e$ is the identity element of $G$. Then
$$\operatorname{ord}(g)\ \mid\ |G|.$$

Equivalently, if $\langle g\rangle$ denotes the {{< knowl id="cyclic-subgroup" text="cyclic subgroup" >}} generated by $g$, then $|\langle g\rangle|=\operatorname{ord}(g)$ and $|\langle g\rangle|\mid |G|$.

This is an immediate corollary of {{< knowl id="lagranges-theorem" text="Lagrange's theorem" >}} applied to the {{< knowl id="subgroup" text="subgroup" >}} $\langle g\rangle\le G$.

**Examples:**
- In the symmetric group $S_3$ (which has $|S_3|=6$), the 3-cycle $(123)$ has $\operatorname{ord}((123))=3$, and $3\mid 6$.
- In the additive group $\mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}$, the element $4$ has order $3$ because $3\cdot 4\equiv 0\pmod{12}$ and no smaller positive multiple is $0$; indeed $3\mid 12$.
- The identity element always has order $1$, and $1$ divides every integer $|G|$.
