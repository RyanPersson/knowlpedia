**Proposition (Uniqueness of identity).**
Let $G$ be a {{< knowl id="group" text="group" >}} with binary operation written multiplicatively. An element $e\in G$ is called an **identity element** if for every $g\in G$ one has $eg=g$ and $ge=g$.
If $e,e'\in G$ are both identity elements, then $e=e'$.

**Context.**
This shows that "the" identity element of a group is well-defined (not dependent on choices).
