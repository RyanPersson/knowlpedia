**A p-group has nontrivial center**: Let $G$ be a finite {{< knowl id="p-group" text="p-group" >}}, i.e. $|G|=p^n$ for some prime $p$ and integer $n\ge 1$. Then the {{< knowl id="center-of-group" text="center" >}} $Z(G)$ is nontrivial; in fact, $|Z(G)|$ is divisible by $p$, so $|Z(G)|\ge p$.

This is a standard application of the {{< knowl id="class-equation" text="class equation" >}}, which decomposes $|G|$ into the size of the center plus sizes of non-central conjugacy classes.
