**Proposition (Closure properties of subgroups).**
Let $H$ be a {{< knowl id="subgroup" text="subgroup" >}} of a {{< knowl id="group" text="group" >}} $G$. Then:

1. The identity element $e$ of $G$ lies in $H$.
2. If $h\in H$, then $h^{-1}\in H$.
3. If $h_1,h_2\in H$, then $h_1h_2\in H$.
4. Consequently, if $h_1,h_2\in H$, then $h_1h_2^{-1}\in H$.

**Context.**
The reverse implication (a nonempty subset closed under $h_1h_2^{-1}$ is a subgroup) is packaged as a {{< knowl id="subgroup-test-one-step" text="subgroup test" >}}, so this proposition is the "easy direction" used constantly in computations.
