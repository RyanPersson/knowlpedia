# Missing Knowls in algebra-groups

The following knowl IDs are referenced in files within `content/algebra-groups/` but do not yet exist. They should be created to complete the linking.

## Ring/Module Theory (needed for number theory connections)

  - `fermats-little-theorem.md` - $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^\times$
  - `automorphism-group-cyclic.md` - $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^\times$
  - `eulers-theorem.md` - $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^\times$

## Representation Theory

- **character** - Referenced in:
  - `class-function.md` - character of a finite-dimensional complex representation
  - `burnsides-pq-theorem.md` - characters of finite groups

- **group-representation** - Referenced in:

## Module Theory
