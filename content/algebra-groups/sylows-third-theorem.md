**Sylow's Third Theorem.**
Let $G$ be a finite {{< knowl id="group" text="group" >}} with $|G| = p^{a}m$ where $p$ is prime and $p\nmid m$. Let $n_p$ denote the number of {{< knowl id="sylow-subgroup" text="Sylow p-subgroups" >}} of $G$. Then:
1. $n_p \mid m$, and
2. $n_p \equiv 1 \pmod p$.

This theorem is a counting consequence of {{< knowl id="sylows-second-theorem" text="Sylow's second theorem" >}} together with the {{< knowl id="normalizer" text="normalizer" >}} and the {{< knowl id="conjugation-action" text="conjugation action" >}} on the set of Sylow $p$-subgroups.
