**Kernels are Normal Subgroups**: Let $f:G\to H$ be a {{< knowl id="group-homomorphism" text="group homomorphism" >}} between groups. Then the {{< knowl id="kernel-group" text="kernel" >}} $\ker(f)$ is a {{< knowl id="normal-subgroup" text="normal subgroup" >}} of $G$.

This fact is what makes {{< knowl id="quotient-group" text="quotient groups" >}} naturally arise from homomorphisms, and it underlies the {{< knowl id="first-isomorphism-theorem-groups" text="first isomorphism theorem" >}}.
