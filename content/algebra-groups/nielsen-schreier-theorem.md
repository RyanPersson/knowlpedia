**Nielsen–Schreier Theorem.**
Let $F$ be a {{< knowl id="free-group" text="free group" >}} and let $H \le F$ be a {{< knowl id="subgroup" text="subgroup" >}}. Then $H$ is a free group.

If $F$ has finite rank $n$ and the {{< knowl id="index-of-subgroup" text="index" >}} $[F:H]$ is finite, then $H$ has finite rank and satisfies the Schreier index formula
$$
\operatorname{rank}(H) = 1 + [F:H]\,(n-1).
$$

This theorem is proved by constructing an explicit free generating set for $H$ from a transversal of cosets; {{< knowl id="schreiers-lemma" text="Schreier's lemma" >}} provides the standard generating set used in the proof. It is a foundational result in combinatorial group theory.
