**Proposition (Prime order implies cyclic).**
Let $G$ be a finite {{</* knowl id="group" text="group" */>}} with $|G|=p$ where $p$ is prime. Then $G$ is cyclic; more precisely, for every $g\in G$ with $g\neq e$, one has $G=\langle g\rangle$.

**Context.**
This is one of the first applications of {{</* knowl id="lagranges-theorem" text="Lagrange's theorem" */>}}: subgroup orders must divide the group order.

**Proof sketch.**
Pick $g\neq e$. The cyclic subgroup $\langle g\rangle$ is a subgroup of $G$, hence its order divides $|G|=p$. Since $g\neq e$, $\langle g\rangle$ is nontrivial, so $|\langle g\rangle|\neq 1$, forcing $|\langle g\rangle|=p$. Therefore $\langle g\rangle=G$.
