**Proposition (Prime order implies cyclic).**
Let $G$ be a finite {{< knowl id="group" text="group" >}} with $|G|=p$ where $p$ is prime. Then $G$ is cyclic; more precisely, for every $g\in G$ with $g\neq e$, one has $G=\langle g\rangle$.

**Context.**
This is one of the first applications of {{< knowl id="lagranges-theorem" text="Lagrange's theorem" >}}: subgroup orders must divide the group order.
