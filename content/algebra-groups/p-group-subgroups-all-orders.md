**Proposition (Subgroups of all orders in a finite p-group).**
Let $p$ be a prime and let $G$ be a finite {{< knowl id="p-group" text="p-group" >}} with $|G|=p^n$. Then for every integer $k$ with $0\le k\le n$ there exists a {{< knowl id="subgroup" text="subgroup" >}} $H\le G$ such that $|H|=p^k$.

**Context.**
This is a structural strengthening of Lagrange's theorem for $p$-groups: not only do subgroup orders divide $|G|$, all intermediate $p$-powers actually occur. It is proved by induction using the existence of nontrivial center.
