A {{< knowl id="group-action" text="group action" >}} of a group $G$ on a set $X$ is **free** if for every $x\in X$, the {{< knowl id="stabilizer" text="stabilizer" >}} $G_x$ is the {{< knowl id="trivial-subgroup" text="trivial subgroup" >}}. Equivalently, the condition
"$g\cdot x = x$ for some $x$"
forces $g=e$.

Free actions are one half of the definition of a {{< knowl id="regular-action" text="regular action" >}} (free + transitive).

**Examples:**
- The left translation action of $G$ on itself is free.
- The action of $G$ on the coset space $G/H$ by left multiplication is free iff $H=\{e\}$.
- The action of $C_n$ on the vertices of a regular $n$-gon by rotation is free when restricted to the vertex set (no nontrivial rotation fixes a vertex).
