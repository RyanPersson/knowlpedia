description: "The number assigned by a probability measure to an event."

A **probability of an event** in a {{< knowl id="probability-space" text="probability space" >}} $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$ is the number $\mathbb{P}(A)$ assigned to an event $A\in\mathcal{F}$.

Because events are {{< knowl id="measurable-set" section="measure-theory" text="measurable sets" >}} and $\mathbb{P}$ is a {{< knowl id="probability-measure" text="probability measure" >}}, event probabilities satisfy the usual axioms (nonnegativity, countable additivity on disjoint events, and normalization).

**Examples:**
- In a fair coin toss space, the event $A=\{H\}$ has probability $\mathbb{P}(A)=1/2$.
- In the uniform space on $[0,1]$, the event $A=[0,1/2]$ has probability $\mathbb{P}(A)=1/2$.
