title: "Absolute value on ℝ"
description: "The nonnegative magnitude |x| of a real number x, equal to its distance from 0."

The **absolute value** of a real number $x\in\mathbb{R}$ is
$$
|x| :=
\begin{cases}
x,& x\ge 0,\\
-x,& x<0.
\end{cases}
$$

Equivalently, $|x|=\sqrt{x^2}$ and $|x|$ is the distance from $x$ to $0$ in $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual metric $d(x,y)=|x-y|$. Absolute value is fundamental for defining convergence, continuity, and error bounds in one-variable analysis.

**Examples:**
- $|3|=3$ and $|-3|=3$.
- $|0|=0$.
- $|x-y|$ measures the distance between $x$ and $y$ in $\mathbb{R}$.
