title: "Complement"
description: "The elements of a fixed universe that are not in the set."

Fix a **universe set** $U$ (an ambient set containing all sets under discussion). The **complement** of $A\subseteq U$ (relative to $U$) is
$$A^c := U\setminus A = \{x\in U : x\notin A\}.$$

Complements are fundamental in topology and measure theory because "closed" is defined as "complement of open," and many set identities are most naturally expressed using complements.

**Examples:**
- If $U=\mathbb{R}$ and $A=[0,1]$, then $A^c = (-\infty,0)\cup(1,\infty)$.
- If $U=\{1,2,3\}$ and $A=\{1,3\}$, then $A^c=\{2\}$.
- If $A=\varnothing$, then $A^c=U$; if $A=U$, then $A^c=\varnothing$.
