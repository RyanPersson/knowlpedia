description: "Numbers of the form a+bi with i^2=-1, forming a field extending the reals."

The **complex numbers** are
$$\mathbb{C}:=\{a+bi : a,b\in\mathbb{R},\ i^2=-1\}.$$
Addition and multiplication are defined by
$$(a+bi)+(c+di)=(a+c)+(b+d)i,$$
$$(a+bi)(c+di)=(ac-bd)+(ad+bc)i.$$

The field $\mathbb{C}$ is a two-dimensional real vector space and can be identified with $\mathbb{R}^2$ via $a+bi\leftrightarrow(a,b)$. Complex numbers are the natural setting for Fourier analysis, power series, and many aspects of analysis and geometry.

**Examples:**
- $z=3-2i$ has real part $3$ and imaginary part $-2$.
- $(1+i)^2 = 1+2i+i^2 = 2i$.
- The real numbers embed into $\mathbb{C}$ via $a\mapsto a+0i$.
