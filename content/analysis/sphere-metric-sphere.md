description: "The set of points at distance exactly r from a center point in a metric space."

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space, let $x\in X$, and let $r\ge 0$. The **(metric) sphere** of radius $r$ centered at $x$ is
$$S(x,r):=\{y\in X : d(x,y)=r\}.$$

Spheres generalize the usual circles and spheres in Euclidean geometry. They are useful for describing boundaries of balls and for constructing examples in metric topology.

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb{R}$, $S(a,r)=\{a-r,a+r\}$ if $r>0$.
- In $\mathbb{R}^2$, $S(0,1)=\{(x,y):x^2+y^2=1\}$ is the unit circle.
- In a discrete metric space, $S(x,1)=X\setminus\{x\}$.
