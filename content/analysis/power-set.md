The **power set** of a set $A$ is
$$\mathcal{P}(A) := \{B : B\subseteq A\}.$$

Power sets organize all possible subcollections of $A$. In analysis they occur implicitly whenever one studies families of subsets (e.g., open sets, measurable sets) as subsets of $\mathcal{P}(X)$ for some ambient set $X$.

**Examples:**
- If $A=\{1,2\}$, then $\mathcal{P}(A)=\{\varnothing,\{1\},\{2\},\{1,2\}\}$.
- $\mathcal{P}(\varnothing)=\{\varnothing\}$.
- If $A$ is finite with $|A|=n$, then $|\mathcal{P}(A)|=2^n$.
