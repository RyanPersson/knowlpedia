title: "Subset"
description: "A set contained in another set, defined by elementwise inclusion."

A **subset** of a set $B$ is a set $A$ such that every element of $A$ is an element of $B$. Formally,
$$A \subseteq B \quad\text{means}\quad \forall x\,(x\in A \Rightarrow x\in B).$$

Subset inclusion $\subseteq$ is the basic relation for comparing sets. Many constructions in analysis (closures, neighborhoods, function spaces) are naturally expressed as subsets of larger ambient sets.

**Examples:**
- $\{1,2\}\subseteq \{1,2,3\}$.
- $\mathbb{Q}\subseteq \mathbb{R}$.
- For every set $A$, $\varnothing \subseteq A$.
