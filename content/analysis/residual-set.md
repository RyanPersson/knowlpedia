title: "Residual set"
description: "A set whose complement is meager."

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. A set $R\subseteq X$ is **residual** (or **comeager**) if its complement is meager:
$$X\setminus R\ \text{is meager in }X.$$

Residual sets are "topologically large" in complete metric spaces: by the Baire category theorem, residual sets are dense (in fact, they contain a dense $G_\delta$ set, though that terminology requires additional definitions).

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb{R}$, the set of irrational numbers $\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}$ is residual, since $\mathbb{Q}$ is meager.
- If $X$ is a complete metric space, then $X$ itself is residual in $X$.
- The complement of a nowhere dense set need not be residual unless the set is meager; residualness is a "countable" notion.
