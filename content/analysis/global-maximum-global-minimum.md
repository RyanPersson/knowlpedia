title: "Global maximum and global minimum"
description: "A point where a function attains the largest/smallest value on its entire domain."

Let $f:E\to\mathbb{R}$ and let $a\in E$.

- The point $a$ is a **global maximum** (or **absolute maximum**) of $f$ on $E$ if
  $$\forall x\in E,\ f(x)\le f(a).$$

- The point $a$ is a **global minimum** (or **absolute minimum**) of $f$ on $E$ if
  $$\forall x\in E,\ f(a)\le f(x).$$

Global extrema are stronger than local extrema and need not exist in general. A central theorem in analysis is that continuous functions on compact sets attain both a global maximum and a global minimum.

**Examples:**
- On $E=[0,1]$, $f(x)=x$ has global minimum at $0$ and global maximum at $1$.
- On $E=(0,1)$, $f(x)=x$ has no global maximum and no global minimum.
- On $E=\mathbb{R}$, $f(x)=x^2$ has a global minimum at $0$ but no global maximum.
