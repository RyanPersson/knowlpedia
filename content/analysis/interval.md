A subset $I\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ is an **interval** if
$$\forall x,y\in I,\ \forall t\in\mathbb{R},\ \bigl(x<t<y \Rightarrow t\in I\bigr),$$
i.e. whenever $x,y\in I$ and $x<y$, every real number between them is also in $I$.

Intervals are exactly the connected subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ (with the usual topology), and they form the natural domains for one-variable analysis (limits, derivatives, integrals).

**Examples:**
- Open intervals $(a,b)$, closed intervals $[a,b]$, and half-open intervals $[a,b)$ are intervals.
- Rays $(a,\infty)$ and $(-\infty,b]$ are intervals.
- The set $(0,1)\cup(2,3)$ is not an interval.
