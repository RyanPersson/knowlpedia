description: "An element that is less than or equal to every element of a given subset in an ordered set."

A **lower bound** of a subset $S$ of an ordered set $(X,\le)$ is an element $\ell\in X$ such that
$$\forall s\in S,\ \ell\le s.$$

Lower bounds formalize the idea that a set lies entirely to the "right" of some point. They are the dual notion to upper bounds and are used in defining infimum.

**Examples:**
- In $(\mathbb{R},\le)$, the set $S=(0,1)$ has lower bounds $\ell=0$, $\ell=-1$, and in fact every $\ell\le 0$.
- In $(\mathbb{R},\le)$, the set $S=\{x\in\mathbb{R}: x\ge 2\}$ has lower bounds $\ell=2$ and every $\ell\le 2$.
- In $(\mathbb{Z},\le)$, the set $S=\{n\in\mathbb{Z}: n\ge 0\}$ has lower bounds $\ell=0$, $\ell=-5$, etc.
