description: "A pair (a,b) in which order matters, characterized by a uniqueness property."

An **ordered pair** $(a,b)$ is an object determined by two entries $a$ and $b$ such that
$$(a,b)=(c,d)\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad (a=c)\ \land\ (b=d).$$

Ordered pairs are the building blocks of Cartesian products, graphs of functions, and relations. The defining property above is what distinguishes an ordered pair from a 2-element set, where order is irrelevant.

**Examples:**
- $(1,2)\neq(2,1)$.
- In $\mathbb{R}^2$, a point is an ordered pair $(x,y)$ with $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$.
- The graph of $f(x)=x^2$ is $\{(x,x^2):x\in\mathbb{R}\}\subseteq\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}$.
