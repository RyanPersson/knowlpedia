title: "Bounded below"
description: "A subset of an ordered set having at least one lower bound."
---

Let $(X,\le)$ be an ordered set and let $S\subseteq X$. The set $S$ is **bounded below** if there exists an element $\ell\in X$ such that
$$\forall s\in S,\ \ell\le s.$$
Equivalently, $S$ is bounded below iff $S$ has a lower bound.

Boundedness below is the hypothesis needed to speak meaningfully about $\inf S$.

**Examples:**
- $(0,1)\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ is bounded below (e.g. by $\ell=0$).
- $\{x\in\mathbb{R}: x\ge -7\}$ is bounded below (e.g. by $\ell=-7$).
- The set $\{ -n : n\in\mathbb{N}\}\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ is not bounded below.
