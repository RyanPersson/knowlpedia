title: "Convergent series"
description: "A series whose sequence of partial sums converges in ℝ or ℂ."

A series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ (with $a_n\in\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$) is **convergent** if its partial sums
$$s_N := \sum_{n=1}^N a_n$$
converge to a limit $s$ as $N\to\infty$. In that case one writes
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n = s.$$

Convergent series provide a rigorous meaning to infinite sums and are essential for analytic expansions and approximation.

**Examples:**
- The geometric series $\sum_{n=0}^\infty r^n$ converges to $\frac{1}{1-r}$ if $|r|<1$.
- $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}$ converges (to $\pi^2/6$, though that value is not needed for the definition).
- $\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n+1}\frac{1}{n}$ converges (alternating harmonic series).
