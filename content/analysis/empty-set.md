The **empty set** is the set $\varnothing$ such that
$$\forall x,\ (x\notin \varnothing).$$

It is the identity for union in the sense that $A\cup \varnothing = A$, and it is the smallest set under $\subseteq$. In analysis, it often appears as a preimage of an impossible condition (e.g., $f^{-1}(B)=\varnothing$ when $B$ misses the range of $f$).

**Examples:**
- $\{x\in\mathbb{R}: x^2+1=0\}=\varnothing$.
- $(0,1)\cap (1,2)=\varnothing$.
- For any set $A$, $A\setminus A=\varnothing$.
