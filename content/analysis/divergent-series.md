description: "A series whose partial sums do not converge."

A series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ (with $a_n\in\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$) is **divergent** if its sequence of partial sums
$$s_N := \sum_{n=1}^N a_n$$
does not converge in $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.

Divergence can occur either because $s_N$ grows without bound (e.g., to $+\infty$) or because it oscillates without approaching a single limit.

**Examples:**
- $\sum_{n=1}^\infty 1$ diverges since $s_N=N\to\infty$.
- $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n}$ diverges (harmonic series).
- $\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n$ diverges because its partial sums oscillate between $-1$ and $0$.
