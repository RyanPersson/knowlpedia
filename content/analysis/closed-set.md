description: "A set whose complement is open in a metric space."

Let $(X,d)$ be a {{< knowl id="metric-space" text="metric space" >}}. A subset $F\subseteq X$ is **closed** if its complement $X\setminus F$ is {{< knowl id="open-set" text="open" >}}.

In metric spaces, closedness is equivalent to several other important properties (e.g., containing limits of {{< knowl id="convergent-sequence" text="convergent sequences" >}} from the set). Closed sets are stable under intersections and are used in defining {{< knowl id="closure" text="closures" >}} and {{< knowl id="compact-set" text="compactness" >}}.

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb{R}$, the interval $[a,b]$ is closed.
- In $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{Z}$ is closed (its complement is a union of open intervals).
- In any metric space, $\varnothing$ and $X$ are closed.
