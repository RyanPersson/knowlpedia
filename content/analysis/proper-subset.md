title: "Proper subset"
description: "A subset that is strictly smaller than the containing set."

A **proper subset** of a set $B$ is a subset $A$ of $B$ that is not equal to $B$. Formally,
$$A \subsetneq B \quad\text{means}\quad (A\subseteq B)\ \land\ (A\neq B).$$

Proper inclusion $\subsetneq$ indicates strict containment. In analysis it is used, for example, to describe dense proper subsets (e.g., $\mathbb{Q}\subsetneq\mathbb{R}$) and strict refinements of covers or partitions.

**Examples:**
- $\mathbb{Q}\subsetneq \mathbb{R}$.
- $\varnothing \subsetneq \{0\}$.
- $\{0\}\not\subsetneq \{0\}$ (it is a subset but not a proper subset).
