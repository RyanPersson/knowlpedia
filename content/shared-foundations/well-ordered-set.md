A **well-ordered set** is a {{< knowl id="set" text="set" >}} $X$ equipped with a {{< knowl id="total-order" text="total order" >}} $\le$ such that every nonempty subset $A\subseteq X$ has a least element; that is, there exists $m\in A$ with $m\le a$ for all $a\in A$.

Well-orderings are central in statements like the {{< knowl id="well-ordering-theorem" text="well-ordering theorem" >}}, which asserts that every set can be well-ordered. The {{< knowl id="well-ordering-principle" text="well-ordering principle" >}} is the special case asserting that $\mathbb{N}$ is well-ordered by its usual order.

**Examples:**
- With the usual $\le$, the {{< knowl id="natural-numbers" text="natural numbers" >}} form a well-ordered set.
- Any finite set becomes well-ordered after choosing a total order; for instance, $\{a_1,\dots,a_n\}$ is well-ordered by declaring $a_1<a_2<\cdots<a_n$.
