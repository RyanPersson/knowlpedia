The **integers** are the {{< knowl id="set" text="set" >}} $\mathbb{Z}=\{\dots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\dots\}$.

The integers extend the {{< knowl id="natural-numbers" text="natural numbers" >}} by including additive inverses, and they sit inside the {{< knowl id="rational-numbers" text="rational numbers" >}} via the identification $n = n/1$. With the usual $\le$, they form a {{< knowl id="total-order" text="totally ordered" >}} set.

**Examples:**
- $-3$, $0$, and $14$ are integers.
- The equation $x+3=0$ has the integer solution $x=-3$.
