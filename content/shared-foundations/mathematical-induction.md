**Mathematical induction:** Let $P(n)$ be a statement about $n\in\mathbb{N}$. If $P(0)$ is true and for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$ the implication $P(n)\Rightarrow P(n+1)$ holds, then $P(n)$ is true for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$.

This is a fundamental method for proving claims indexed by the {{< knowl id="natural-numbers" text="natural numbers" >}}. It is closely connected to the {{< knowl id="well-ordering-principle" text="well-ordering principle" >}}, and each can be derived from the other in standard foundations.
