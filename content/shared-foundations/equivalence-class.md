title: "Equivalence class"
description: "The set of all elements equivalent to a given element under an equivalence relation."

An **equivalence class** of an element $a\in A$ (with respect to an {{< knowl id="equivalence-relation" text="equivalence relation" >}} $\sim$ on $A$) is the set
$$
[a]=\{x\in A : x\sim a\}.
$$

Equivalence classes are subsets of $A$ that bundle together elements deemed “the same” by $\sim$. The collection of all equivalence classes is the {{< knowl id="quotient-set" text="quotient set" >}} $A/{\sim}=\{[a]: a\in A\}$, and it is a {{< knowl id="partition" text="partition" >}} of $A$.

**Examples:**
- If $\sim$ is congruence modulo $3$ on $\mathbb{Z}$, then $[1]=\{\dots,-5,-2,1,4,7,\dots\}$.
- If $\sim$ is equality on a set $A$, then for each $a\in A$ one has $[a]=\{a\}$.
