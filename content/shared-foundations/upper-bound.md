title: "Upper bound"
description: "An element that is greater than or equal to every element of a subset in an ordered set."

An **upper bound** of a subset $A$ of a {{< knowl id="partial-order" text="partially ordered set" >}} $(P,\le)$ is an element $u\in P$ such that $a\le u$ for all $a\in A$. The subset $A$ is **bounded above** if it has at least one upper bound in $P$.

Upper bounds are paired with {{< knowl id="lower-bound" text="lower bounds" >}} and are used to define least upper bounds (the {{< knowl id="supremum" section="real-analysis" text="supremum" >}} in real analysis).

**Examples:**
- In $(\mathbb{Z},\le)$, the integer $10$ is an upper bound for the subset $\{1,4,7\}$.
- In the poset $(\mathcal P(X),\subseteq)$, the set $A\cup B$ is an upper bound for $\{A,B\}$, where $A\cup B$ is the {{< knowl id="union" text="union" >}} of $A$ and $B$.
