title: "Lower bound"
description: "An element that is less than or equal to every element of a subset in an ordered set."

A **lower bound** of a subset $A$ of a {{< knowl id="partial-order" text="partially ordered set" >}} $(P,\le)$ is an element $\ell\in P$ such that $\ell\le a$ for all $a\in A$. The subset $A$ is **bounded below** if it has at least one lower bound in $P$.

Lower bounds complement {{< knowl id="upper-bound" text="upper bounds" >}} and lead to greatest lower bounds (the {{< knowl id="infimum" section="real-analysis" text="infimum" >}} in real analysis).

**Examples:**
- In $(\mathbb{Z},\le)$, the integer $-5$ is a lower bound for the subset $\{-2,0,3\}$.
- In the poset $(\mathcal P(X),\subseteq)$, the set $A\cap B$ is a lower bound for $\{A,B\}$, where $A\cap B$ is the {{< knowl id="intersection" text="intersection" >}} of $A$ and $B$.
