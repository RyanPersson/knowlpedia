**Well-ordering theorem:** For every {{< knowl id="set" text="set" >}} $X$, there exists a {{< knowl id="relation" text="relation" >}} $\le\,\subseteq X\times X$ such that $(X,\le)$ is a {{< knowl id="well-ordered-set" text="well-ordered set" >}}.

Over ZF, the well-ordering theorem is equivalent to the {{< knowl id="axiom-of-choice" text="Axiom of Choice" >}} and to {{< knowl id="zorns-lemma" text="Zorn's lemma" >}}.
