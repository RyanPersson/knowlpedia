An **injective function** is a {{< knowl id="function" text="function" >}} $f:A\to B$ such that whenever $f(a_1)=f(a_2)$, it follows that $a_1=a_2$.

Injectivity means distinct elements of the {{< knowl id="domain" text="domain" >}} remain distinct after applying $f$. In terms of {{< knowl id="cardinality" text="cardinality" >}}, an injective function from $A$ to $B$ is evidence that $A$ is “no larger than” $B$.

**Examples:**
- The inclusion map $i:S\to A$ of a {{< knowl id="subset" text="subset" >}} is injective, since $i(s)=i(s')$ implies $s=s'$.
- The function $f:\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}$ given by $f(n)=2n$ is injective, but it is not surjective onto $\mathbb{Z}$.
