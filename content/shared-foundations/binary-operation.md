description: "A function that combines two elements of a set to produce another element of the same set"

A **binary operation** on a set $S$ is a {{< knowl id="function" text="function" >}} $*:S\times S\to S$, where $S\times S$ is the {{< knowl id="cartesian-product" text="Cartesian product" >}} of $S$ with itself. The value of $*(x,y)$ is usually written $x*y$.

Binary operations are functions with two inputs that are “closed” in the sense that combining two elements of $S$ produces an element of $S$ again. Many algebraic structures begin with a set equipped with a binary operation.

**Examples:**
- Addition $+:\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}$ is a binary operation on {{< knowl id="integers" text="the integers" >}}.
- For a fixed set $A$, the union map $(S,T)\mapsto S\cup T$ is a binary operation on the {{< knowl id="power-set" text="power set" >}} $\mathcal{P}(A)$, using {{< knowl id="union" text="union" >}} of subsets.
