description: "A function that is both one-to-one and onto"

A **bijective function** is a {{< knowl id="function" text="function" >}} $f:A\to B$ that is both {{< knowl id="injective-function" text="injective" >}} and {{< knowl id="surjective-function" text="surjective" >}}.

A bijection sets up a perfect pairing between elements of the domain and codomain, and it is exactly the situation in which an {{< knowl id="inverse-function" text="inverse function" >}} exists. Two sets have the same {{< knowl id="cardinality" text="cardinality" >}} precisely when there is a bijection between them.

**Examples:**
- The function $f:\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}$ given by $f(n)=n+1$ is bijective.
- If $A=\{1,2,3\}$ and $B=\{a,b,c\}$, the function defined by $1\mapsto a$, $2\mapsto b$, $3\mapsto c$ is bijective.
