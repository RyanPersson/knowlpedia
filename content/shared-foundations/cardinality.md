A **cardinality** is the size of a set, understood up to bijection: two {{< knowl id="set" text="sets" >}} $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality if there exists a {{< knowl id="bijective-function" text="bijective function" >}} $f:A\to B$. The cardinality of $A$ is often denoted $|A|$.

Cardinality comparisons can be expressed using {{< knowl id="injective-function" text="injections" >}} and {{< knowl id="surjective-function" text="surjections" >}} between sets. A set is {{< knowl id="countable-set" text="countable" >}} when its cardinality is at most that of the {{< knowl id="natural-numbers" text="natural numbers" >}}.

**Examples:**
- The {{< knowl id="empty-set" text="empty set" >}} has cardinality $|\varnothing|=0$.
- If $A=\{1,2,3\}$, then $|A|=3$, and the {{< knowl id="power-set" text="power set" >}} $\mathcal{P}(A)$ has $|\mathcal{P}(A)|=8$.
