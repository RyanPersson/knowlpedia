The **natural numbers** are the {{< knowl id="set" text="set" >}} $\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,\dots\}$. (Some authors use $\{1,2,3,\dots\}$ instead; when needed, the chosen convention should be stated.)

Natural numbers are used to index a {{< knowl id="sequence" text="sequence" >}} and to formulate principles such as {{< knowl id="mathematical-induction" text="mathematical induction" >}} and the {{< knowl id="well-ordering-principle" text="well-ordering principle" >}}. They embed naturally into the {{< knowl id="integers" text="integers" >}}.

**Examples:**
- The numbers $0,1,2,3$ are elements of $\mathbb{N}$.
- The subset $\{n\in\mathbb{N} : n \text{ is even}\}$ is an infinite subset of $\mathbb{N}$.
