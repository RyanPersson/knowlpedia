A **domain** is the set of inputs of a function: if $f:A\to B$ is a {{< knowl id="function" text="function" >}}, then its domain is the set $A$.

Changing the domain (for example by taking a {{< knowl id="restriction-of-a-function" text="restriction" >}}) produces a new function, even if the output rule looks the same. The elements of the domain appear as the first components of {{< knowl id="ordered-pair" text="ordered pairs" >}} in the {{< knowl id="graph-of-function" text="graph" >}} of $f$.

**Examples:**
- For $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x)=x^2$, the domain is $\mathbb{R}$ (the {{< knowl id="real-numbers" text="real numbers" >}}).
- For the inclusion map $i:S\to A$ with $S\subseteq A$, the domain is $S$.
