**ZFC axioms:** ZFC is the first-order theory in the language with equality and the membership relation $\in$ whose axioms are the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms together with the {{< knowl id="axiom-of-choice" text="Axiom of Choice" >}}. A common presentation includes:
- **Extensionality:** sets with the same elements are equal.
- **Empty set:** an {{< knowl id="empty-set" text="empty set" >}} exists.
- **Pairing:** for any $a,b$ there exists a set $\{a,b\}$.
- **Union:** for any set $A$ there exists $\bigcup A$ (a set containing exactly the elements of the members of $A$), aligning with {{< knowl id="union" text="union" >}} constructions.
- **Power set:** for any set $A$ there exists its {{< knowl id="power-set" text="power set" >}} $\mathcal P(A)$.
- **Infinity:** an inductive set exists, enabling the construction of the {{< knowl id="natural-numbers" text="natural numbers" >}}.
- **Separation schema:** definable {{< knowl id="subset" text="subsets" >}} of a set are sets.
- **Replacement schema:** images of sets under definable functions are sets.
- **Foundation (regularity):** every nonempty set has an $\in$-minimal element.

Within ZFC one can develop most standard mathematics, and ZFC proves statements equivalent in strength to choice such as {{< knowl id="zorns-lemma" text="Zorn's lemma" >}} and the {{< knowl id="well-ordering-theorem" text="well-ordering theorem" >}}.
