The **rational numbers** are the {{< knowl id="set" text="set" >}} $\mathbb{Q}$ of fractions $p/q$ with $p,q\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $q\ne 0$, where $p/q$ and $p'/q'$ represent the same rational number exactly when $pq'=p'q$.

One way to formalize this identification is to view $\mathbb{Q}$ as a {{< knowl id="quotient-set" text="quotient set" >}} of {{< knowl id="ordered-pair" text="ordered pairs" >}} of {{< knowl id="integers" text="integers" >}} under an {{< knowl id="equivalence-relation" text="equivalence relation" >}}. The rationals embed into the {{< knowl id="real-numbers" text="real numbers" >}}.

**Examples:**
- $\frac{2}{3}$ and $-\frac{7}{4}$ are rational numbers.
- Every integer $n$ corresponds to the rational number $n/1$.
