A **surjective function** is a {{< knowl id="function" text="function" >}} $f:A\to B$ such that for every $b\in B$ there exists at least one $a\in A$ with $f(a)=b$.

Surjectivity can be expressed using the {{< knowl id="image" text="image" >}}: $f$ is surjective exactly when $f(A)$ equals its {{< knowl id="codomain" text="codomain" >}} $B$. Surjectivity is one of the two conditions (along with injectivity) needed for a {{< knowl id="bijective-function" text="bijection" >}}.

**Examples:**
- The function $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ given by $f(x)=x^3$ is surjective, since every real number has a real cube root.
- The parity map $p:\mathbb{Z}\to\{0,1\}$ (even $\mapsto 0$, odd $\mapsto 1$) is surjective.
