A **countable set** is a set $A$ for which there exists an {{< knowl id="injective-function" text="injective function" >}} $f:A\to\mathbb{N}$, where $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of {{< knowl id="natural-numbers" text="natural numbers" >}}. Equivalently, $A$ is countable if it is finite or there exists a {{< knowl id="bijective-function" text="bijective function" >}} between $A$ and $\mathbb{N}$.

Countability is a statement about {{< knowl id="cardinality" text="cardinality" >}}: a set is countable exactly when its size is no larger than that of $\mathbb{N}$. Many constructions in analysis and topology distinguish sharply between countable and uncountable sets.

**Examples:**
- {{< knowl id="integers" text="The integers" >}} $\mathbb{Z}$ form a countable set (they can be arranged in a sequence).
- {{< knowl id="rational-numbers" text="The rational numbers" >}} $\mathbb{Q}$ form a countable set.
