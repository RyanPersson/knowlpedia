description: "Every family of nonempty sets has a choice function."

**Axiom of Choice:** For every indexed family $(A_i)_{i\in I}$ of nonempty sets, there exists a {{< knowl id="function" text="function" >}} $f:I\to \bigcup_{i\in I} A_i$ such that $f(i)\in A_i$ for all $i\in I$.

Equivalently, every {{< knowl id="indexed-family-of-sets" text="indexed family of sets" >}} of nonempty sets admits a choice function selecting one element from each set. In the presence of the other ZF axioms, this axiom is equivalent to {{< knowl id="zorns-lemma" text="Zorn's lemma" >}} and to the {{< knowl id="well-ordering-theorem" text="well-ordering theorem" >}}.
