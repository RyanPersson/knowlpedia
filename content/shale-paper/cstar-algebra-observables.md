A **\(C^*\)-algebra** is a norm-closed *-subalgebra of bounded operators with \(\|A^*A\|=\|A\|^2\).

In §6, \(\mathfrak A\) is the uniform (operator-norm) closure of the algebra generated by Weyl unitaries
\(\exp(iR(z))\) based on finite-dimensional subspaces.

**Key properties (paper use):**
- \(\mathfrak A\) is abstractly independent of the chosen representation (Segal).
- Symplectic \(T\) act by *-automorphisms \(\theta(T)\) on \(\mathfrak A\).

**Example:** \(B(\mathcal H)\) (all bounded operators) is a \(C^*\)-algebra.
