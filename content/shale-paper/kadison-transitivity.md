A form of **Kadison's theorem** used in §6: if \(\mathfrak A\) acts irreducibly on \(\mathcal H\) and \(x,y\in\mathcal H\),
then there exists \(A\in\mathfrak A\) with \(Ax=y\).

**Key property (paper use):**
- Lets Shale characterize "relative normalizability" of states via \(F(X)=E(A^*XA)\).

**Example:** In \(B(\mathcal H)\), take \(A\) to be a rank-one operator sending \(x\) to \(y\).
