Given a complex {{< knowl id="hilbert-space" section="linear-algebra" text="Hilbert space" >}} \(H\), its **single particle structure** is
\(\Sigma(H)=(K,B)\), where \(K\) is \(H\) viewed as a *real* Hilbert space with inner product \(\Re(\cdot,\cdot)_c\),
and \(B(z_1,z_2)=\Im(z_1,z_2)_c\).

**Key properties:**
- \(B\) is a {{< knowl id="symplectic-form" text="symplectic form" >}} on \(K\) (skew + nondegenerate).
- Symmetries of the free boson field act as \(B\)-preserving maps on \(K\).

**Example:** \(H=L^2(\mathbb R^d)\) gives a real phase space \(K\) with \(B=\Im(\cdot,\cdot)\).
