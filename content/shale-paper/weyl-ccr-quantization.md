A **quantization** of \((K,B)\) assigns to each \(z\in K\) a selfadjoint operator \(R(z)\) so that
\(V(z)=e^{iR(z)}\) satisfies the **Weyl relations**
\[
V(z_1)V(z_2)=e^{-iB(z_1,z_2)/2}\,V(z_1+z_2).
\]

**Key property (paper use):**
- Shale requires \(V(\cdot)\) to be weakly continuous on each finite-dimensional subspace (regularity).

**Example:** In 1D, \(V(p,q)=e^{i(pP+qQ)}\) with \([P,Q]=i\).
