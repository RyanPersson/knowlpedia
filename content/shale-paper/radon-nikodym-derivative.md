If measures \(\nu\) and \(\mu\) satisfy \(\nu\ll\mu\) (absolute continuity), the **Radon–Nikodym derivative**
\(\frac{d\nu}{d\mu}\) is the (a.e. unique) function \(X\) with
\(\nu(S)=\int_S X\,d\mu\) for all measurable \(S\).

**Key property (paper use):**
- Shale writes \(X(T)=\frac{dn(T)}{dn}\) for the Gaussian pushforward (the "Jacobian").

**Example:** For \(\nu=f\mu\) with \(f\ge0\), one has \(d\nu/d\mu=f\).
