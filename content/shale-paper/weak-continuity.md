A unitary representation \(\pi:G\to U(\mathcal H)\) is **weakly continuous** if
\(g\mapsto (\pi(g)x,y)\) is continuous for all \(x,y\in\mathcal H\).

For a **projective** representation \(\overline{\pi}\), Shale uses:
\(g\mapsto |(\overline{\pi}(g)x,y)|\) continuous.

**Key property (paper use):**
- Theorem 3.1 proves weak continuity of \(\mathfrak U\); Theorem 4.2 lifts this to \(\overline{Y}\).

**Example:** Any strongly continuous unitary representation is weakly continuous.
