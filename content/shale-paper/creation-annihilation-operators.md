description: "Operators adding/removing one symmetric tensor factor in bosonic Fock space"

On {{< knowl id="symmetric-fock-space" text="symmetric Fock space" >}} \(S(H)\), the **creation operator** \(C(z)\)
adds a particle:
\(C(z)(x_1\otimes\cdots\otimes x_n)_s=\sqrt{n+1}\,(z\otimes x_1\otimes\cdots\otimes x_n)_s\).

Its adjoint \(C^*(z)\) is the **annihilation operator**.

**Key property (paper use):**
- The (unbounded) field operator is \(R(z)=\tfrac1{\sqrt2}(C(z)+C^*(z))^{\sim}\).

**Example:** \(C(z)e_0=z\in \mathrm{Sym}^1(H)\).
