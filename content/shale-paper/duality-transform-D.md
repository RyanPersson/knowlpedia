Segal's **duality transform** \(D: S(H)\to L_2(M,n)\) is a unitary identifying the Fock space picture
with the Gaussian \(L_2\) picture.

**Key properties (paper use):**
- Transports the Fock–Cook operators to \(L_2(M,n)\): \(R(z)=D(C(z)+C^*(z))^{\sim}D^{-1}\).
- Makes \(Q(x)\) a multiplication operator and \(P(x)\) its Wiener transform conjugate.

**Example:** In 1D, this corresponds to the Hermite-function realization of the oscillator basis.
