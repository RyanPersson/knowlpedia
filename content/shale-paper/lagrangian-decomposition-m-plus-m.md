Shale fixes a real subspace \(M\subset K\) so that \(K=\Lambda^{-1}M\oplus M\), written \(K=M\oplus M\).

Then every \(z\in K\) is \(z=x\oplus y\) with \(x,y\in M\), and \(\Lambda(x\oplus y)=-y\oplus x\).

**Key properties:**
- Positive symplectic operators can be conjugated to block form \(S^{-1}\oplus S\) on \(M\oplus M\).
- Field operators split into "\(P(x)\)" and "\(Q(x)\)" parts.

**Example:** For \(K=\mathbb R^{2n}\), take \(M=\mathbb R^n\) as the \(q\)-coordinates.
