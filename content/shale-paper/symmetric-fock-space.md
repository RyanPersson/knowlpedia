title: "Symmetric Fock Space S(H)"
description: "The bosonic Fock space ⊕_{n≥0} Sym^n(H) with vacuum vector"
---

The **symmetric (bosonic) Fock space** over \(H\) is
\[
S(H)=\bigoplus_{n=0}^\infty \mathrm{Sym}^n(H),
\]
with vacuum vector \(e_0\in \mathrm{Sym}^0(H)\cong \mathbb C\).

**Key properties (paper use):**
- Carries creation/annihilation operators and the Fock–Cook field operators.
- The canonical action of \(U(H)\) second-quantizes to a unitary action on \(S(H)\).

**Example:** If \(H=\mathbb C\), then \(S(H)\cong \ell^2(\mathbb N_0)\).
