A **state** on a \(C^*\)-algebra \(\mathfrak A\) is a linear functional \(E\) with \(E(I)=1\) and \(E(A^*A)\ge0\).

**Pure** means not a nontrivial convex combination of other states.

In Shale's CCR setting, **regular** means \(z\mapsto E(A^*e^{iR(z)}B)\) is continuous on each finite-dimensional subspace.

**Example:** In a representation on \(\mathcal H\), \(E(X)=(Xx,x)\) for a unit vector \(x\).
