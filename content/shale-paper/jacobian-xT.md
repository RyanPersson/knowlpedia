title: "Jacobian X(T) in Shale's Gaussian Setup"
description: "The Radon–Nikodym derivative of the transformed Gaussian measure n(T) with respect to n"
---

For \(T\in rGL(M)\), Shale defines a new measure \(n(T)\) via pullback on \(L_\infty\),
and sets
\[
X(T)=\frac{dn(T)}{dn},
\]
the {{< knowl id="radon-nikodym-derivative" text="Radon–Nikodym derivative" >}}.

**Key properties (paper use):**
- \(X(T)^{1/2}\in L_2(M,n)\) and appears in the unitary implementer \(\mathfrak U(T)\).
- When \(|T|\in GL(M)_1\), \(X(T)\) has an explicit "Gaussian quadratic form" formula.

**Example:** In finite dimensions, \(X(T)\) reduces to \(|\det T|\) times an exponential factor.
