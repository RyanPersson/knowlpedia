title: "Field Automorphism θ(T) from a Symplectic Map"
description: "The *-automorphism induced by sending Weyl operators V(z) to V(Tz)"

For \(T\in Sp(K)\), \(\theta(T)\) is the unique *-automorphism of the CCR \(C^*\)-algebra \(\mathfrak A\) such that
\[
\theta(T)\,e^{iR(z)} = e^{iR(Tz)}.
\]

It induces an action on states by pullback:
\(\theta^*(T)E(X)=E(\theta(T)^{-1}X)\).

**Key property (paper use):**
- \(E\sim \theta^*(T)E\) holds exactly when \(T\) is unitarily implementable in the chosen quantization.

**Example:** In finite dimensions, metaplectic operators implement \(\theta(T)\) projectively.
