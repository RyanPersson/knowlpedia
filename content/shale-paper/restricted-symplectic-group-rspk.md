description: "The implementable symplectic transformations in Shale's Fock representation"
---

The **restricted symplectic group** is
\[
\mathrm{rSp}(K)=\mathrm{Sp}(K)\cap \mathrm{rGL}(K),
\]
where $\mathrm{rGL}(K)$ is the {{< knowl id="restricted-general-linear-group-rgl" text="restricted general linear group" >}}.

In Shale's Theorem 4.1 (Fock–Cook quantization), \(T\) is unitarily implementable iff \(T\in rSp(K)\),
equivalently \((T^*T)^{1/2}-I\) is {{< knowl id="hilbert-schmidt-operator" text="Hilbert–Schmidt" >}}.

**Key properties:**
- Closed under {{< knowl id="polar-decomposition" text="polar decomposition" >}}.
- Carries a continuous projective unitary representation \(\overline{Y}\).

**Example:** Finite-dimensional case: \(rSp(K)=Sp(K)\).
