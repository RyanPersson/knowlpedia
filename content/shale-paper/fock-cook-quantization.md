description: "The standard bosonic CCR representation built from creation/annihilation operators"

In the Fock–Cook representation on \(S(H)\), the field operator is
\[
R(z)=\frac1{\sqrt2}\,(C(z)+C^*(z))^{\sim},
\]
where \((\cdot)^{\sim}\) denotes closure as an unbounded operator.

**Key properties (paper use):**
- Produces Weyl unitaries \(V(z)=e^{iR(z)}\) satisfying {{< knowl id="weyl-ccr-quantization" text="Weyl CCR" >}}.
- Shale's main result: \(T\in Sp(K)\) is implementable iff \(T\in rSp(K)\).

**Example:** For finite-dimensional \(H\), this is the usual Schrödinger/Fock CCR representation.
