For \(T\in rGL(M)\), the unitary operator \(\mathfrak U(T)\) on \(L_2(M,n)\) is
\[
(\mathfrak U(T)f)(x)=X(T)^{1/2}\,f(T^*x),
\]
where \(X(T)\) is the {{< knowl id="jacobian-xT" text="Jacobian" >}}.

**Key properties (paper use):**
- Implements pullback automorphisms on multiplication operators:
\(M_{\phi(T)g}=\mathfrak U(T)M_g\mathfrak U(T)^{-1}\).
- Theorem 3.1: \(T\mapsto \mathfrak U(T)\) is weakly continuous.

**Example:** For 1D scaling \(x\mapsto \lambda x\), \(\mathfrak U\) is a Gaussian-weighted dilation.
