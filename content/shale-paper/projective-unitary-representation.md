title: "Projective Unitary Representation"
description: "A group action by unitaries defined only up to phase (unitary rays)"

A **projective unitary representation** assigns each \(g\in G\) a **unitary ray**
\(\overline{U}(g)=\{\alpha U(g):|\alpha|=1\}\), with multiplication holding up to a phase (a cocycle).

**Key properties (paper use):**
- Shale's implementers \(Y(T)\) are unique only up to phase, so \(\overline{Y}\) is projective.
- In finite dimensions, \(\overline{Y}\) lifts to a genuine double-valued unitary representation (§5).

**Example:** Spin representations are projective representations of rotation groups.
