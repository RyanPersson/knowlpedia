Segal's **normal distribution over \(M\)** is a probability space \((N,\mathfrak R,n)\) such that
each {{< knowl id="tame-function" text="tame function" >}} \(f(x)=\bar f(Px)\) has expectation
given by the finite-dimensional Gaussian integral on \(\mathrm{ran}(P)\).

**Key properties (paper use):**
- Defines \(L_p(M,n)\) spaces used throughout §3.
- Quasi-invariance under $T$ holds exactly for $T\in \mathrm{rGL}(M)$ (see {{< knowl id="restricted-general-linear-group-rgl" text="restricted general linear group" >}}).

**Example:** In finite dimensions, this is the standard density \(\propto e^{-\|x\|^2/2c}\,dx\).
