title: "Strong vs Weak Operator Topology"
description: "Two common convergence notions for bounded operators on a Hilbert space"
---

For operators \(T_n,T\) on a Hilbert space:

- **SOT (strong):** \(T_n\to T\) if \(T_nx\to Tx\) for every vector \(x\).
- **WOT (weak):** \(T_n\to T\) if \((T_nx,y)\to (Tx,y)\) for all vectors \(x,y\).

**Key properties (paper use):**
- Continuity of group actions/representations is often stated in WOT.
- On unitary/orthogonal groups, these topologies are commonly used for "weak continuity".

**Example:** If \(\|T_n-T\|\to0\) (operator norm), then \(T_n\to T\) in both SOT and WOT.
