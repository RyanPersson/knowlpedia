title: "Restricted General Linear Group rGL(H)"
description: "Invertible operators whose positive part differs from I by a Hilbert–Schmidt operator"

Shale's **restricted general linear group** is
\[
rGL(H)=\{T\in GL(H): |T|=(T^*T)^{1/2}\in GL(H)_2\}.
\]

Equivalently, \(|T|-I\) is {{< knowl id="hilbert-schmidt-operator" text="Hilbert–Schmidt" >}}.
This group is exactly where the Gaussian measure in §3 is quasi-invariant.

**Key properties:**
- Stable under {{< knowl id="polar-decomposition" text="polar decomposition" >}} \(T=u(T)|T|\).
- Carries the "change-of-variables" unitary rep {{< knowl id="segal-unitary-representation-Ufrak" text="𝔘(T)" >}} on \(L_2(M,n)\).

**Example:** In finite dimensions, \(rGL(H)=GL(H)\).
