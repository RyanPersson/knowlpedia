title: "Trace-Class Operator"
description: "An operator with absolutely summable singular values (Schatten class 1)"
---

A bounded operator \(X\) is **trace-class** if its trace norm \(\|X\|_1<\infty\)
(equivalently, the singular values are \(\ell^1\)).

**Key properties (paper use):**
- The trace \(\mathrm{tr}(X)\) is well-defined and basis-independent.
- The "determinant" \(\Delta(I+X)\) extends to \(I+\)trace-class ({{< knowl id="fredholm-determinant-trace-log" text="Fredholm determinant" >}}).

**Example:** On \(\ell^2\), \(\mathrm{diag}(a_n)\) is trace-class iff \(\sum_n |a_n|<\infty\).
