title: "Complex Structure Λ on K"
description: "An operator Λ with Λ² = −I giving K the structure of a complex Hilbert space"
---

A **complex structure** on a real Hilbert space \(K\) is a bounded operator \(\Lambda\) with \(\Lambda^2=-I\).

In the paper, \(\Lambda z = i z\) on \(K=H\) viewed as real, and it relates symplectic and adjoint operations:
a regular \(T\) is symplectic iff \(\Lambda T\Lambda^{-1}=T^{*-1}\).

**Key properties:**
- Lets one write \(K=M\oplus M\) with \(\Lambda(x\oplus y)=-y\oplus x\).
- Identifies \(U(H)=O(K)\cap Sp(K)\).

**Example:** On \(\mathbb R^{2n}\), \(\Lambda(p,q)=(-q,p)\).
