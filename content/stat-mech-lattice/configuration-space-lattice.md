title: "Configuration space (lattice)"
description: "The product space of all spin configurations on a lattice, equipped with its natural sigma-algebra (and often a product topology)."

Fix a {{< knowl id="spin-space" text="spin space" >}} $(S,\mathcal{S})$ and consider the integer lattice (see {{< knowl id="lattice-zd" section="discrete-structures" text="integer lattice" >}}). The **(infinite-volume) configuration space** is
$$
\Omega := S^{\mathbb{Z}^d},
$$

the set of all assignments $\sigma = (\sigma_i)_{i\in\mathbb{Z}^d}$ with $\sigma_i \in S$.

The natural measurable structure on $\Omega$ is the **product sigma-algebra**
$$
\mathcal{F} := \bigotimes_{i\in\mathbb{Z}^d} \mathcal{S},
$$

generated by **cylinder events** (events depending only on finitely many sites). This is the standard setting for defining Gibbs measures as {{< knowl id="probability-measure" section="probability" text="probability measures" >}} on $(\Omega,\mathcal{F})$ (see {{< knowl id="probability-space" section="probability" text="probability space" >}}).

For a finite region $\Lambda$ (e.g. {{< knowl id="finite-box-lattice" section="discrete-structures" text="finite box" >}}), the **finite-volume configuration space** is
$$
\Omega_\Lambda := S^\Lambda,
$$

with sigma-algebra $\mathcal{F}_\Lambda := \bigotimes_{i\in\Lambda}\mathcal{S}$.

## Key properties
- **Cylinder sigma-algebra and locality:** Any local observable depending on finitely many spins is measurable with respect to $\mathcal{F}_\Lambda$ for some finite $\Lambda$. This matches the locality of typical {{< knowl id="interaction-potential-phi" text="interactions" >}} and {{< knowl id="lattice-hamiltonian" text="Hamiltonians" >}}.
- **Product measures and a priori structure:** If a single-site a priori measure $\rho$ is chosen on $S$, one obtains a product measure on $\Omega$ (see {{< knowl id="product-measure" section="measure-theory" text="product measure" >}}). Finite-volume Gibbs measures are often absolutely continuous with respect to the corresponding product measure on $\Omega_\Lambda$.
- **Shifts (translations):** Translations of the lattice act on $\Omega$ by shifting coordinates. Translation invariance of interactions (see {{< knowl id="translation-invariant-interaction" text="translation-invariant interaction" >}}) often leads to translation-invariant Gibbs measures.
- **Topology (when used):** If $S$ is finite or compact and metrizable, $\Omega$ can be given the product topology, and then $\Omega$ is compact by Tychonoff’s theorem. This is convenient for existence/compactness arguments in equilibrium theory.

## Physical interpretation
$\Omega$ is the **phase space** (more precisely, the configuration or sample space) of a lattice spin system: each $\sigma\in\Omega$ is a full microscopic state. Equilibrium statistical mechanics selects probability measures on $\Omega$—finite-volume (see {{< knowl id="finite-volume-gibbs-measure" text="finite-volume Gibbs measures" >}}) and infinite-volume (see {{< knowl id="infinite-volume-gibbs-measure" text="infinite-volume Gibbs measures" >}})—that encode typical configurations and fluctuations, as formalized by the {{< knowl id="gibbs-specification" text="Gibbs specification" >}} and {{< knowl id="dlr-equation" text="DLR equation" >}}.
