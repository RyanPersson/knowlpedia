title: "DLR Gibbs measures satisfy a spatial Markov property"
description: "A DLR Gibbs measure has conditional distributions given by the Gibbs specification; for finite-range interactions, dependence is only through boundary spins."
---

Let $\mu$ be an {{< knowl id="infinite-volume-gibbs-measure" section="stat-mech-lattice" text="infinite-volume Gibbs measure" >}} for a {{< knowl id="lattice-hamiltonian" section="stat-mech-lattice" text="lattice Hamiltonian" >}} with finite-range interaction, and let $\gamma=\{\gamma_\Lambda\}$ be the associated {{< knowl id="gibbs-specification" section="stat-mech-lattice" text="Gibbs specification" >}}.

Write $\mathcal{F}_\Lambda$ for the $\sigma$-algebra generated by spins in $\Lambda$ and $\mathcal{F}_{\Lambda^c}$ for the outside.

## Statement
If $\mu$ satisfies the {{< knowl id="dlr-equation" section="stat-mech-lattice" text="DLR equation" >}}, then for every finite region $\Lambda$ and every bounded local function $f$ depending only on spins in $\Lambda$,
$$
\mathbb{E}_\mu\!\left[f \mid \mathcal{F}_{\Lambda^c}\right](\sigma)
= \int f(\eta)\,\gamma_\Lambda(d\eta \mid \sigma_{\Lambda^c})
\quad\text{for $\mu$-a.e. }\sigma.
$$

Equivalently, the conditional law of $\sigma_\Lambda$ given $\sigma_{\Lambda^c}$ is $\gamma_\Lambda(\cdot\mid\sigma_{\Lambda^c})$.

Moreover, if the interaction has finite range (e.g. nearest-neighbor), then $\gamma_\Lambda(\cdot\mid\sigma_{\Lambda^c})$ depends on $\sigma_{\Lambda^c}$ only through the configuration in a finite “boundary neighborhood” of $\Lambda$ (in the nearest-neighbor case, only the spins on the lattice boundary $\partial\Lambda$). In this sense, $\mu$ has a spatial Markov property.

## Key hypotheses
- $\mu$ is an {{< knowl id="infinite-volume-gibbs-measure" section="stat-mech-lattice" text="infinite-volume Gibbs measure" >}} satisfying the {{< knowl id="dlr-equation" section="stat-mech-lattice" text="DLR equation" >}} for some specification $\gamma$.
- The interaction is finite range (to conclude “boundary-only” dependence).

## Conclusions
- Conditionals are local: the law inside $\Lambda$ given outside is the corresponding finite-volume Gibbs law with boundary condition induced by $\sigma_{\Lambda^c}$.
- For finite-range interactions, conditioning on the entire exterior is equivalent to conditioning on finitely many boundary spins (a Markov-type locality statement).
